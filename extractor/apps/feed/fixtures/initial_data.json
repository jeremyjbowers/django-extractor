They lost Round 2 when regulators began turning the law into rules.  But business groups fighting regulatory measures adopted in response to the financial crisis could still score a knockout in another arena: the federal courts. A recent appeals court decision could spell trouble for the Securities and Exchange Commission as it puts in place some of the most far-reaching Wall Street regulations in years, experts say. The potential points of contention include issues as diverse as whistleblower rewards, derivatives trading and executive pay. The ruling also could prompt court challenges to the work of other agencies, including environmental regulations that corporations denounce as damaging to the economy. In a ruling that has captured the attention of Washington lobbyists and policy wonks,  a three-judge panel said the SEC did not adequately analyze the economic consequences of a rule that would make it easier for shareholders to oust members of corporate boards. The court declared that the SEC had acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously.\u201d In declaring the SEC\u2019s cost-benefit analysis inadequate, the judges set what might be an impossibly high standard, some observers say. \u201cWhat the court is doing is second-guessing economic analysis that can always be second-guessed,\u201d said J. Robert Brown Jr., a professor at the University of Denver\u2019s Sturm College of Law. In justifying the rule, the SEC had said that it would improve the way corporations are run. \u201cBut how do you prove that empirically?\u201d asked Harvey J. Goldschmid, a professor at Columbia Law School and a former Democratic SEC commissioner. \u201cIf the court\u2019s unrealistic requirements were applied across the board, the regulatory process would grind to a halt,\u201d he said. The case pitted two of the capital\u2019s most influential business groups against the government\u2019s primary Wall Street watchdog.  It\u2019s  called Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America v. Securities and Exchange Commission. In a July decision, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington struck down a new SEC rule that would have allowed major shareholders to place board candidates on a company ballot. Boards are generally self-perpetuating; the incumbent directors decide whose names appear on the ballots mailed at company expense. If outsiders want to challenge the official slate, they must mount a \u201cproxy contest,\u201d which can be as much of an uphill battle as a political write-in campaign if not more so because it involves sending voting materials to shareholders at the challengers\u2019 expense. The SEC said the new rule could make board members more responsive to shareholders and more independent from management, and less complacent.  By improving the way companies are run, the rule could increase shareholder value and restore  investor confidence, the SEC said. In adopting the rule, the agency was using authority granted by Congress last year to extend proxy access to shareholders. Advocates of the new SEC rule, including labor unions and pension funds, argue that letting major shareholders have access to the corporate ballot would bring greater democracy and accountability to the boardroom.  Some proponents have criticized boards as bastions of cronyism where directors all too willingly award executives excessive compensation. On the other side, the Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives, and the Chamber of Commerce said labor unions could abuse ballot or \u201cproxy\u201d access by advancing agendas at odds with the interests of other shareholders. The business representatives also argued that the SEC failed to account for expenses companies would incur campaigning against outside nominees for board seats. In the so-called proxy access rule, the SEC devoted nearly 80 pages to a cost-benefit analysis, trying to quantify with precision some costs that are inherently unpredictable even as the agency justified the rule based on intangible value judgments. In the document issued last August laying out the rule, the SEC acknowledged that companies might spend money campaigning against outside board candidates and listed a range of estimated costs companies have incurred in past proxy contests. But the agency said campaign spending was not required by the rule. The opinion issued by the three judges, all appointed by Republican presidents, accused the SEC of failing to address concerns raised by industry in formal comments submitted as part of the rule-making process. \u201cThe SEC needs to more seriously address the concerns raised by commenters in the rule-making process,\u201d Business Roundtable Executive Director Larry Burton said in a written response to questions. The decision also could force the SEC to focus more on economic analysis. Paul S. Atkins, a former Republican SEC commissioner, said that, instead of letting economic analysis guide policy, the SEC has long used it to rationalize policy that the agency has already charted. Eugene Scalia, a lawyer who argued the case for the business groups, said court rulings make it clear that the SEC can act in the absence of complete or perfect data, as long as it does its best. But he added, \u201cIf it just doesn\u2019t know that what it\u2019s doing is positive, it shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d An SEC spokesman declined to discuss the court ruling in any depth. The agency is still assessing its options, which include abandoning the undertaking, appealing the decision or rewriting the rule. The decision comes as regulators are already behind schedule writing rules to implement the sweeping Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted last year in response to the financial meltdown of 2008. Rules still on the drawing board include a new regulatory regime for trading in derivatives, which have been both a cash cow and a source of risk for Wall Street, and additional disclosure requirements for executive pay. One measure would force companies to publish the ratio of the chief executive\u2019s pay to that of the typical employee. Businesses have argued that this proposal would be costly and impractical to implement. hilzenrath@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 07:47:34", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcombusinesseconomyappeals-decision-is-a-victory-for-opponents-of-secs-new-wall-street-regulations20110805giqagsag8i_storyhtmlwprssrss_business"}}, {"pk": 155, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 14:25:49", "headline": "Tiny, wireless stick-on patches may one day monitor patients\u2019 hearts, other vital signs", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/industries/tiny-wireless-stick-on-patches-may-one-day-monitor-patients-hearts-other-vital-signs/2011/08/11/gIQApYN18I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tWASHINGTON \u2014 One day monitoring a patient\u2019s vital signs like temperature and heart rate could be a simple as sticking on a tiny, wireless patch, sort of like a temporary tattoo. Eliminating the bulky wiring and electrodes used in current monitors would make the devices more comfortable for patients, says an international team of researchers who report their findings in Friday\u2019s edition of the journal Science.  \u201cWhat we are trying to do here is to really reshape and redefine electronics ... to look a lot more like the human body, in this case the surface layers of the skin,\u201d said John A. Rogers of the University of Illinois. \u201cThe goal is really to blur the distinction between electronics and biological tissue.\u201d The researchers embedded electronic sensors in a film thinner than the diameter of a human hair, which was placed on a polyester backing like those used for the temporary tattoos popular with kids. The result was a sensor that was flexible enough to move with the skin and would adhere without adhesives. The researchers said the devices had remained in place for up to 24 hours. Rogers said in an briefing that, while normal shedding of skin cells would eventually cause the monitors to come off, he thought they could remain in place as long as two weeks. In addition to monitoring patients in hospitals, other uses for the devices could include monitoring brain waves, muscle movement, sensing the larynx for speech, emitting heat to help heal wounds and perhaps even being made touch sensitive and placed on artificial limbs, Rogers said. The device will help fill the need for equipment that is more convenient and less stressful for patients, permitting easier and more reliable monitoring, said Zhenqiang Ma, an engineering professor at the University of Wisconsin, who was not part of the research team. The electronic skin can simply be stuck on or peeled off like an adhesive bandage, he noted in a commentary on the report. Rogers is a founder of the company MC10, based in Cambridge, Mass., which is working to develop commercial uses of the devices, but he declined to speculate on how soon the electronic skin would be ready for market or what it would cost. The monitor looks rather like a bandage and contains an antenna that could be used to transmit data, though a radio to do that transmitting has not yet been tested, Rogers said. The current design has a small coil and could be powered by induction \u2014 by placing it near an electrical coil \u2014 Rogers said.  That would permit intermittent use, he said, and for longer-term monitoring a tiny battery or storage capacitor could be used. The monitor doesn\u2019t use an adhesive, relying on a weak force called the van der Waals force that causes molecules and surfaces to stick together without interfering with motion. The ability of geckos to climb smooth surfaces has been attributed to the van der Waals force. For longer-term use the electronic skin could be coated with an adhesive. Rogers and co-lead author Dae-Hyuong Kim, have been working on the technology for several years. They earlier worked together to develop flexible electronics for hemispherical camera sensors and other devices that have complex shapes. Funding for the research came from the Air Force Research Laboratory, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois, and a Defense Department National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship. ___ Online: Science: http://www.sciencemag.org Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

The deal puts Capital One at the forefront of a niche market it only entered into at the start of this year. The company made its foray into the space in January by picking up the credit card portfolio of Canadian retail conglomerate Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. That deal was followed up in April when J.P. Morgan Chase sold Kohl\u2019s Department Stores\u2019s card portfolio, handing over more than 20 million accounts and the right to issue cards to Kohl\u2019s customers.  After the HSBC sale is finalized, Capital One would issue cards for such retailers as Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Best Buy.   Analysts said the store-brand credit card business is rebounding, after a precipitous decline during the downturn. Delinquencies and charge-offs have slowed in the past year, while stricter standards on traditional cards have made store cards more appealing to consumers.  Private-label cards typically carry higher interest rates and lower credit lines than general-purpose plastic. Consumers with limited credit options tend to rely on these cards, and because they are unsecured there is always the looming risk of delinquencies and defaults. \u201cCapital One has proven to be pretty good credit managers through this cycle, and this is a way for them to continue to leverage their card expertise and get some loan growth,\u201d said Donald Fandetti, an analyst at Citi Investment Research.  Issuers are drawn to the high fee income of store cards. Retailers that offer private-label cards tend to have a vast distribution network of stores, allowing issuers to hedge their bets against regional distress. \u201cYou have a captive audience and a strong marketing system because the merchant is incentivized to push your product,\u201d Sanjay Sakjrani, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods.  What\u2019s more, the shrinking field of private label card issuers \u201cmight provide an opportunity for existing players to not only take market share, but share more of the risk with merchants,\u201d Sakjrani said. \u201cSome of the terms were pretty egregious for the issuers prior to the recession.\u201d  Still, there are challenges for Capital One. Delving deeper into the card business against the backdrop of a foundering economy could prove risky, if consumers become more cautious in their spending, said Robert Hammer, head of the credit card consulting firm R.K. Hammer.  Capital One, he added, will have to \u201cput together an attractive feature and benefit menu for cardholders to get them to use that card even more\u201d and runs the risk of \u201ccardholder defection.\u201d  Hammer said the company should be able to manage those issues.  Capital One has been undergoing a larger tranformation than just getting into the private-label credit card business. The nation\u2019s fourth-largest credit card issuer is in the process of turning itself into a mainstream consumer bank and announced a $9 billion deal to buy online bank ING Direct in June. Capital One\u2019s HSBC deal is slated to close in the second quarter of next year. The lender may raise up to $1.25 billion in equity to help finance the deal and has the option of paying HSBC $750 million in stock, at $39.23 per share. Capital One anticipates that integration will cost $420 million, but expects to reduce the portfolio\u2019s operating expenses by $350 million. The firm is projecting roughly 25 percent return on its investment in the new portfolio in 2013.  douglasd@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 13:53:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcombusinesseconomycapital-one-snags-hsbc-credit-card-business20110810giqarj136i_storyhtmlwprssrss_business"}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 1, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:18", "headline": "French bankers try _ and fail _ to calm markets, European regulators tighten surveillance", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/markets/french-bank-societe-generale-demands-probe-into-stock-selloff-following-market-rumors/2011/08/11/gIQAnHM27I_story.html?wprss=rss_business", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tPARIS \u2014 France, Italy, Spain and Belgium are banning short-selling on select stocks amid efforts to calm market turmoil that has sent bank shares gyrating wildly and aggravated worries about Europe\u2019s huge debts. The European Union\u2019s markets supervisor, the ESMA, announced the move late Thursday night after boosting surveillance of stormy markets earlier in the day. The move capped two days of whipsaw trading that saw French banks\u2019 market value fall and rise by billions of euros. In a short sale, a trader hopes to make a profit by betting on the decline in the price of a share. The practice has been blamed for contributing to market volatility. The ESMA said in a statement that the four countries \u201chave today announced or will shortly announce new bans on short-selling or on short positions\u201d as of Friday. The French market regulator, the AMF, announced late Thursday that it is banning for 15 days net short-selling on 11 stocks, including those of banks Societe Generale, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole and leading insurers. Belgium\u2019s market authority said it would ban short-selling on financial shares such as leading banks and insurers as of Friday. Belgium had already banned naked short selling, basically a bet on a decline in the price of a share without borrowing the share, since August 2008. Several countries banned short selling amid the financial crisis of 2008 to try to tame volatility. But some experts said the bans actually contributed to a feeling of uncertainty. French bankers and officials scrambled to soothe investors\u2019 nerves after days of suggestions that France could be the next major economy to lose its coveted triple-A credit rating. By late in the day, those efforts appeared to have an effect, but economists said the rebound remained very fragile. The European Union\u2019s markets supervisor said Thursday that regulators were increasing surveillance of financial markets following the days of steep selloffs. Bank of France head Christian Noyer blamed \u201cunfounded rumors\u201d for plunges in the shares of top banks, including Societe Generale and BNP Paribas, and said the country\u2019s financial institutions were sound. The country\u2019s market regulator warned of sanctions against anyone who fuels or profits from rumors that fed the sell-off. Noyer said that French banks\u2019 first-half earnings \u201cconfirmed their solidity in a difficult economic environment\u201d and that the banks\u2019 capital cushions were healthy. French bank stocks fell Thursday until strong U.S. jobs data helped propel solid gains on Wall Street late in the European trading day. BNP Paribas closed up 0.3 percent and Societe Generale rose 3.7 percent. France is taking pains to assure markets that it won\u2019t be the next to see its credit rating downgraded. Attention will be on France\u2019s release of second-quarter GDP figures on Friday. Some have warned that France could suffer if it has to spend significant new money to bail out more struggling eurozone states. The leaders of the eurozone\u2019s biggest economies, Germany and France, announced they will meet Tuesday to discuss solutions to Europe\u2019s financial difficulties. French President Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s office said that the two will come up with \u201cjoint proposals\u201d on the governance of the eurozone before the end of the summer. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman said the meeting would focus on suggestions for how to improve the zone\u2019s economic policy and crisis management. All three leading credit rating agencies reaffirmed their triple-A assessment of France, and analysts said they could not identify a trigger for the market turmoil.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing behind it, it\u2019s a market of malintentioned speculators trading on pure rumors,\u201d said Marc Touati, an economist at French trading firm Assya Compagnie Financiere. After Societe Generale, France\u2019s second-biggest bank, saw its share price drop nearly 15 percent Wednesday, the bank asked the French market regulator to investigate the rumors that it was on the ropes because of its heavy exposure to debt from troubled eurozone economies. Societe Generale CEO Frederic Oudea called the rumors \u201ctotally unfounded\u201d and \u201cirrational.\u201d Speaking on France-Info radio, he urged calm and insisted that the bank\u2019s fundamentals are sound. Oudea said Societe Generale had already accounted for its exposure to Greece\u2019s debts in its second quarter earnings. France\u2019s growth prospects are considerably better than those of Italy and Spain\u2019s, but its economic expansion is slowing and it\u2019s failed for years to reduce a deficit that stood at 7.1 percent last year. No other eurozone economy with a triple-A rating has a higher debt than France\u2019s \u2014 around 85 percent of national income. Adding to market worries, French presidential elections scheduled for the spring of 2012 may make it difficult for the government to implement further austerity measures at a time when the economy is slowing. Elsewhere in Europe, Greece announced a rise in unemployment after a series of unpopular austerity measures aimed at dragging it out of debt that sparked troubles across the eurozone. And Italy\u2019s finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, told lawmakers Thursday that tough and speedy measures are needed over the next two years to balance the budget in 2013. The market turbulence has seen Italy\u2019s borrowing costs in the markets spike up to uncomfortably high levels. ___ Gabriele Steinhauser in Brussels and Melissa Eddy in Berlin contributed to this report.

But a broad cross-section of money managers offered them the same simple advice: just calm down.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeople on the verge of panic about the performance of their 401(k)s or other investments should take a deep breath and methodically review their investment strategies, money managers and financial planners said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cAt times like this, you have to embrace your inner Spock,\u201d said Charles Sizemore, the Dallas-based editor of the Sizemore Investment Letter. \u201cThere is nothing like a good crisis to make you re-evaluate your investment plan.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter multiple market crashes of the past few years, it has become a familiar refrain: Does your portfolio have a good mix of stocks and bonds? When do you need the money you have invested? If that time is far off, you shouldn\u2019t react to every drop in the markets. But if you bought, say, energy stocks on the expectation of robust economic growth in the near future, \u201cyou might want to reconsider,\u201d Sizemore added.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbove all, the advisers say, resist the urge to make a quick buck off the market\u2019s violent shifts.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAverage-Joe investors are up against sophisticated computers that use complex algorithms to sense market trends and trigger stock transactions. The machines enable Wall Street types to reap huge profits by reacting to news in microseconds, and they leave little room for ordinary people to make money trading on home computers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, so-called high-frequency trades account for 70 percent of stock trading in the United States, according to a report by the Brattle Group, an economic consultancy.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaking the landscape more inscrutable is the complexity of world events fueling the market gyrations, from financial uncertainty in Europe to political dysfunction in Washington.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cToo often we see with our clients that people are prone to react to every piece of news that affects the market,\u201d said Marshall Berol, co-portfolio manager of the San Francisco-based Encompass Fund. \u201cThey would be better not to react to each development because they come so rapidly. The trick is separating out day-to-day and hour-to-hour headlines from the underlying factors driving those headlines.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the curse of modern times is that the traditional advice of being patient and trusting that the markets will eventually provide returns doesn\u2019t seem to be paying off.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tU.S. stocks have been notoriously uneven over the past decade. The Dow Jones industrial average is actually below the level it hit in 2000 \u2014 and that does not even account for the cost of inflation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter the financial crisis triggered historic losses that bottomed out in March 2009, investors have seen stock prices move on a generally upward path \u2014 until recently. Stocks are now in the red for the year.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot knowing what else to do with their money, most American investors have grimly held on through the ups and downs. The percentage of U.S. households that owned mutual funds peaked in 2001 at 48 percent and was still at 45 percent last year, according to Investment Company Institute, which represents mutual fund and other investment companies.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOver the past three years, as the nation has struggled through the Great Recession and its aftermath, three-quarters of investors continued to plow the same or greater sum into mutual funds, according to an ICI survey released earlier this year. At the same time, the survey found that only about a third of investors shifted away from stocks to more conservative assets, including bonds and money market funds.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe problem with safer investments is that they may not provide enough returns for retirement.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSo even in uncertain times, asset managers say that investors can do well if they remain determined not to respond emotionally to market swings, while keeping a careful eye to balance their holdings among a diverse mix  of stocks and bonds.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBerol and others say average investors are best advised to stick to the basics and not try to make sense of the frenzy of activity surrounding the market.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cInvestors should be looking at it as a buying opportunity,\u201d said Gordon Bernhardt, founder of Bernhardt Wealth Management, a McLean asset management firm. \u201cEvery investor should have some sort of  market allocation plan. Now is the time to rebalance and get back to that original strategy.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBernhardt pointed out that an investment portfolio diligently balanced among large cap, small cap, and foreign stocks, as well as bonds, would allow investors to earn strong returns even when individual stock indexes are flat for prolonged periods of time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Although the Dow has been flat, Bernhardt said, \u201ca globally diversified portfolio would have doubled its value over the past decade.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfletcherm@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 17:30:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcombusinesseconomymoney-managers-simple-advice-to-average-investors-just-dont-panic20110811giqa0kvi9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_business"}}, {"pk": 166, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 1, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:29", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:08", "headline": "Virginia\u2019s Cuccinelli sues Bank of New York Mellon, alleging pension fraud", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/virginias-cuccinelli-sues-bank-of-new-york-mellon-alleging-pension-fraud/2011/08/11/gIQAKTfg9I_story.html?wprss=rss_business", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tRICHMOND \u2014 In a highly unusual move, Virginia sued a major New York financial institution late Thursday, alleging that it defrauded state and local pension funds and seeking an extraordinary $900 million in damages and penalties.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe lawsuit, filed by Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II, claims that since 2000 the Bank of New York Mellon defrauded the Virginia Retirement System and the pension funds in Arlington and Fairfax counties 73,000 times.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cNow all of Virginia taxpayers are harmed,\u201d Cuccinelli (R) said in an interview. \u201cIf you assume the taxpayers are going to make good on whatever obligations these funds undertake, really the people who are going to be harmed by this as a particular matter are the taxpayers.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCuccinelli is seeking $120 million plus interest in damages and $811 million in civil penalties for what he alleges is $40 million in fraud. He accuses currency traders for the bank of skimming profits of transactions conducted for six state and local public pension funds by falsely reporting the rate at which currency was exchanged.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe bank is disputing the claims and will fight them in court, a spokesman said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThe lawsuit filed by the Virginia attorney general is unwarranted and reflects a flawed understanding of foreign currency markets,\u201d Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine said. \u201cWe will fight these claims in court and are confident we will prevail. .\u2009.\u2009.While our first choice is always an amicable resolution, we refuse to be coerced into paying for and admitting to wrongdoing where none exists.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe lawsuit, filed in Fairfax County under the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, a 2002 statute designed to encourage whistleblowers to come forward, is one of the largest non-health-care cases brought anywhere in the nation, legal experts say.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the history of the federal version of the state law, there have been only two pharmaceutical cases that received more than $1\u00a0billion in damages and penalties. Both were brought by the U.S. Justice Department and more than 20 states.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCuccinelli intervened in January in a lawsuit filed by a private whistleblower that sought $150\u00a0million in damages from the Bank of New York Mellon, which has served as the master custodian of the Virginia Retirement System since 1988. After mediation failed last week, he filed a lawsuit.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe\u2019re always willing to listen, but, in our judgment, we reached a point where they just don\u2019t take their offense seriously,\u201d he said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the attorney general\u2019s office, the bank is paid $4.5\u00a0million a year to hold and protect Virginia\u2019s pensions. It manages $55.1 billion in state and local government retirement funds.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe suit was initiated by a Delaware-based partnership called FX Analytics, whose members, according to the legal complaint, had \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of the fraud based on \u201cextensive knowledge and experience\u201d with the Bank of New York Mellon.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThe damages in the attorney general\u2019s complaint are based on hard data and are not plucked from thin air for shock value,\u201d said Zachary Kitts, an attorney for FX Analytics.\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to Cuccinelli\u2019s office, the Bank of New York Mellon would watch currency markets and conduct trades on behalf of Virginia at the most advantageous price it could find during a trading day. But when the bank reported the results of the trade to the state, it would report that the state had received the day\u2019s least advantageous price. It would then pocket the difference, the lawsuit claims.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Virginia suit is similar to one filed in California in 2009 by then-Attorney General Jerry Brown (D) against State Street, seeking $200 million in damages over the same alleged foreign currency exchange practices. The California suit remains in litigation; State Street has denied wrongdoing. In October, Washington state announced that it had reached an $11.7 million settlement with State Street Bank, resolving a similar dispute.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn addition to the funds it holds for Virginia\u2019s pension fund, the Bank of New York Mellon is also paid $400,000 a year to serve in the same role for the $4.9 billion Fairfax retirement system and receives almost $136,000 annually from Arlington to serve as custodian of the county\u2019s $1.27 billion pension.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCuccinelli said he has received calls from officials in other states, which are now researching their pension funds contracts with Bank of New York Mellon.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkumaranita@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 17:44:03", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaldc-politicsvirginias-cuccinelli-sues-bank-of-new-york-mellon-alleging-pension-fraud20110811giqaktfg9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_business"}}, {"pk": 7, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 1, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:18", "headline": "Wisconsin GOP\u2019s stand could reverberate elsewhere", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/wisconsin-gops-stand-could-reverberate-elsewhere/2011/08/10/gIQAtgYV7I_story.html?wprss=rss_business", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tMADISON, WIS. \u2014 Wisconsin Democrats brushed aside their failure to seize control of the state Senate through recall elections, instead insisting Wednesday that voters rejected the Republican vision for the state and the country and vowing to press on with their plan to recall Gov. Scott Walker (R). Democratic challengers won just two of the six Republican-held Senate seats contested in Tuesday\u2019s elections, yet party officials said those victories exposed the electorate\u2019s anger at Walker and at GOP lawmakers in Wisconsin and elsewhere who have shown little interest in political compromise. But as the Democratic faithful turn their attention to delivering their potentially pivotal state to President Obama in next year\u2019s election, they may find it hard to maintain the momentum that has fueled their recall efforts. Voters might balk if faced with more of the political turmoil that has engulfed Wisconsin politics and dominated the airwaves since Walker took office in January. After becoming governor, Walker wasted no time in advancing his conservative agenda. He refused to concede on his signature law stripping public workers of most collective-bargaining rights, even after Senate Democrats fled the state to try to block its passage and angry protesters packed the Capitol for nearly a month. Walker took a conciliatory tone when asked about the recall election results, saying he thinks voters want the two parties to cooperate more on creating jobs and improving the economy. \u201cPeople still want us to focus on those two priorities,\u201d he said. Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D) said it\u2019s too early to tell where the Walker recall effort might go. Two Democratic state senators face their own recall elections next week. Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate said the two wins Tuesday would add momentum to a Walker recall campaign. Wisconsin law requires those seeking a recall to collect 540,208 signatures within 60 days, starting no sooner than November. Wisconsin Democratic activist Sachin Chheda said that ideally, a recall election would coincide with the 2012 general election. But Reid Magney, a spokesman for the state\u2019s election oversight board, cautioned that several factors, including the time needed to check petition signatures and delays resulting from legal challenges, mean that there is no guarantee the elections would coincide. Tuesday\u2019s recall elections were closely watched by officials in other states, and afterward there was a hint of relief among some Republicans, who said the results showed that the political environment hasn\u2019t changed much since 2010. \u201cThe dynamic guiding the 2012 political environment is still, first and foremost, the state of the economy,\u201d said Republican strategist Kevin Madden. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who signed pension and benefits legislation in June that also raised worker contributions and curtailed collective bargaining, said he was happy for Walker but didn\u2019t think the votes had national implications. \u201cWisconsin is Wisconsin, and New Jersey is New Jersey,\u201d Christie said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of similarities between the two.\u201d \u2014 Associated Press\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 18:54:32", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcombusinesseconomywisconsin-gops-stand-could-reverberate-elsewhere20110810giqatgyv7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_business"}}, {"pk": 114, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:17:54", "headline": "Pentagon names 30 troops killed in downed helicopter in Afghanistan", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pentagon-names-30-troops-killed-in-downed-helicopter-in-afghanistan/2011/08/11/gIQAEl5h8I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tWASHINGTON \u2014 The American troops killed in the deadliest single mission of the Afghanistan war came from two dozen states and all corners of the nation, mostly young men in their 20s and 30s. The Pentagon Thursday released the list of the 30 killed, along with their ages and hometowns in states from Florida to Minnesota, and from Hawaii to Massachusetts. Also Thursday, five U.S. troops were killed by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan. Some of the names of troops killed in the helicopter crash were already known because their families have spoken about them since the Saturday downing of their helicopter by insurgents. Eight Afghans also died. But the Pentagon first released the full list of the dead on Thursday, after an internal discussion over whether to identify those who were covert special operations troops. The Special Operations Command had asked officials to withhold the names because of security worries. The majority of the dead were special operations forces, including members of SEAL Team 6, the unit that killed Osama bin Laden. Military officials said none of the crash victims were on that mission in Pakistan against the al-Qaida leader. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta decided to hold to Pentagon policy of releasing names. Those killed were 17 members of the elite Navy SEALs, five Naval Special Warfare personnel who support the SEALs, three Air Force Special Operations personnel and an Army helicopter crew of five.

The company, like most food and beverage makers, has raised prices to offset higher costs for everything from coffee to fuel. Many companies are struggling to find the right balance, but Sara Lee has been willing to sacrifice sales volume to maintain profit margins. Sara Lee\u2019s results also were impacted because it\u2019s been shedding units to become leaner before it splits its remaining business into two companies by early next year __ one focused on coffee and the other largely on meat.  \u201cIt\u2019s a year of transition,\u201d said Sara Lee\u2019s Executive Chairman Jan Bennink. \u201cBut we feel good about it.\u201d The company, based in Downers Grove, Ill., earned $111 million, or 19 cents per share, for the quarter. That\u2019s down from $187 million, or 28 cents per share, a year ago. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 20 cents per share, meeting analyst expectations. Price hikes helped send its total revenue up 9 percent to $2.3 billion, topping expectations of $2.28 billion, according to FactSet. But the hikes also negatively impacted profit. Results also were hurt by the company\u2019s strategy to shed business units. The company, like several major U.S. companies, has been doing so as part of its strategy to move away from large corporations with a vast array of brands to smaller ones that are able to focus better on their areas of expertise. To that end, two days ago, Sara Lee said that it will sell its North American refrigerated dough business to Ralcorp for $545 million. And the company said Thursday that it has potential bidders for its international bakery business and it hopes to make an announcement soon. Ultimately, Sara Lee said it\u2019s planning to realize $180 million to $200 million in costs savings during fiscal 2012 and 2013 as it prepares for the spinoff of its business.  \u201cI think we have a clear, clear, clear objective \u2014 what we want to do is we want to create two simpler, faster and much more entrepreneurial pure play companies than we currently have,\u201d Bennink said. For the year, Sara Lee earned $1.29 billion, or $2.06 per share. That compares with earnings of $506 million, or 72 cents per share, in the previous year. Annual revenue rose to $8.68 billion from $8.34 billion. Looking ahead, the company issued a full-year outlook below analysts\u2019 expectations and its shares fell in trading Thursday. Sara Lee expects fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings of 89 cents to 95 cents per share on revenue of $8.5 billion to $8.75 billion. The guidance excludes the international bakery segment, which the company plans to sell. Analysts predict earnings of $1.07 per share on revenue of $9.35 billion. Shares of the company were down 29 cents, or nearly 2 percent, to $17.02 in afternoon trading. Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

If the Postal Service was a private sector business, it would have filed for bankruptcy and utilized the reorganization process to restructure its labor agreements to reflect the new financial reality,\u201d the document continues.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a white paper on health and retirement benefits, the USPS said it was imperative to rein in health benefit and pension costs, which are a third of its labor expenses.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor health insurance plans, the paper said, the Postal Service wanted to withdraw its 480,000 pensioners and 600,000 active employees from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program \u201cand place them in a new, Postal Service administered\u201d program.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlmost identical language is used for the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees Retirement System.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe USPS said the programs do not meet \u201cthe private sector comparability standard,\u201d a statement that could be translated as meaning that government plans are too generous and too costly.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cFEHB may exceed what the private sector does in certain areas,\u201d said Anthony J. Vegliante, USPS chief human resources officer and executive vice president. \u201cIt may not meet what the private sector does in other areas. So cost may be above the private sector, while value may be below the private sector.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBills that would rein in employee benefits or have workers pay more for the benefits have been introduced in Congress and met with vigorous opposition from federal employee organizations. Intentionally or not, the Postal Service\u2019s proposal provides support for such legislative initiatives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe proposals are the USPS\u2019s latest money-saving effort in a series of moves, some as recent as a few weeks ago and others stretching over a decade. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Postal Service has reduced its workforce by 212,000 positions in the past 10 years and recently announced it is considering the closing of 3,700 post offices. It also has asked Congress to allow it to deliver mail five days a week instead of six and to change a requirement that it pre-fund retiree health benefits.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe USPS said it needs to reduce its workforce by 120,000 career positions by 2015, from a total of about 563,400, on top of the 100,000 it expects by attrition. Some of the 120,000 could come through buyouts and other programs, but a significant number would probably result from layoffs if Congress allows the agency to circumvent union contracts.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cUnfortunately, the collective bargaining agreements between the Postal Service and our unionized employees contain layoff restrictions that make it impossible to reduce the size of our workforce by the amount required by 2015,\u201d according to the optimization document. \u201cTherefore, a legislative change is needed to eliminate the layoff protections in our collective bargaining agreements.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe layoff protection, however, does not apply to employees with fewer than six years of service, which presumably would include thousands of workers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPostal union leaders quickly and sharply rejected the plans.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThe APWU will vehemently oppose any attempt to destroy the collective bargaining rights of postal employees or tamper with our recently negotiated contract \u2014 whether by postal management or members of Congress,\u201d American Postal Workers Union President Cliff Guffey said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cOur advisers are not encouraging us at all to even consider it,\u201d said National Rural Letter Carriers\u2019 Association President Don Cantriel.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe are absolutely opposed\u201d to the layoff proposal, he said. \u201cWe are opposed to pulling out of the Federal Employees Health Benefits plan.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNational Association of Letter Carriers President Fredric V. Rolando said: \u201cThe issues of lay-off protection and health benefits are specifically covered by our contract. .\u2009.\u2009. The Congress of the United States does not engage in contract negotiations with unions, and we do not believe they are about to do so.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow Congress will respond to the proposals, however, remains to be seen. Many Republicans, including those who have sponsored legislation that labor considers anti-union, may support the plan. Some Democrats, for which organized labor is an ally, could back union opposition. But the Postal Service\u2019s critical financial situation could make some Democrats have second thoughts.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwo members of Congress who have introduced separate postal reform bills were noncommittal on the USPS plan.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA spokeswoman for Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) said, \u201cHe is particularly interested in learning whether these proposals would be fair to employees and effective in reducing the Postal Service\u2019s costs.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said: \u201cThese new ideas from the Postal Service are worth exploring. Options for reform and cost savings that will protect taxpayers from paying for a bailout, now or in the future, need to be on the table.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead more on PostPolitics.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Fed Page\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRomney: \u2018Corporations are people\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElizabeth Warren weighing Senate bid\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfederaldiary@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 17:24:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsusps-proposes-cutting-120000-jobs-pulling-out-of-health-care-plan20110811giqazxim9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_business"}}, {"pk": 169, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 1, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:32", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:08", "headline": "London riots: Britain weighs personal freedoms against need to keep order", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/britain-weighs-personal-freedoms-against-need-to-keep-order/2011/08/11/gIQAMTOS8I_story.html?wprss=rss_business", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tLONDON \u2014 After four nights of lawlessness that has upended British society and seen 1,200 alleged looters and arsonists swept off the streets, the government is also targeting a digital culprit: social media.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGovernments from China to the authoritarian regimes challenged by the Arab Spring have sought to control social networking sites, fearing their power to connect and organize dissidents hungry for democracy. But Britain is weighing an unprecedented move to intervene in the personal communication of its citizens after concluding just the opposite: that social media, including BlackBerry Messenger and Twitter, are undermining its vibrant democracy.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe plan touched off an immediate firestorm in Britain\u2019s thriving social media community, igniting charges of an assault on freedom of speech. Prime Minister David Cameron, however, made clear that he felt the greater threat was allowing violent speech to circulate.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cEveryone watching these horrific actions will be struck by how they were organized via social media,\u201d Cameron said in an emergency session of Parliament on Thursday, during which he announced that officials were working with the intelligence services and police to look at how and whether to \u201cstop people communicating via these Web sites and services when we know they are plotting violence, disorder and criminality.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCameron said: \u201cFree flow of information can be used for good. But it can also be used for ill. And when people are using social media for violence, we need to stop them.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolice in Britain have been monitoring social networking sites \u2014 and pouncing. Authorities in England and Scotland, for instance, have arrested more than a dozen youths on suspicion of using the Internet and text messages to incite unrest. In Greater Manchester, hit hard by rioting Tuesday night, the police fought fire with fire, issuing this warning from an official police Twitter account: \u201cIf you have been using social networking sites to incite disorder, expect us to come knocking on your door very soon.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Twitter universe in Britain was among the first to respond to Cameron\u2019s announcement, with irate comments flooding the nation\u2019s digital space. Spoofing Sky News \u2014 Fox News\u2019s sister network in Britain \u2014 one Twitter user employed classic British humor as political statement, sending out a fake bulletin: \u201cBreaking: Sky News understands David Cameron has been in talks with the Chinese government to share web-filter technologies.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFurthering a nascent debate here over civil rights in the aftermath of the riots were additional emergency measures outlined by Cameron.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe government announced that it would start slapping \u201cgang injunctions\u201d \u2014 now used for adults \u2014 on underage teens, using court-ordered restraining orders to ban them, for instance, from wearing gang colors or walking around their neighborhoods with attack dogs. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolice have also been authorized to force suspicious-looking people who have their faces covered by, say, bandannas and \u201choodies\u201d \u2014 the uniform of British hooligans and gang members \u2014  to identify themselves. The government is also reviewing the possibility of imposing curfews.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWith police forces here stretched to the limit, Cameron said the government will draft contingency plans to have the army take over backroom tasks for Scotland Yard and other forces to free them up for street patrols in the event that it becomes necessary. Although he said such steps were not needed at the moment \u2014 city streets were largely quiet across Britain on Wednesday and Thursday, possibly in part because of the beefed-up police presence \u2014 some in the opposition criticized the suggestion.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWhether it\u2019s a popular thing to say or not, a further militarization of the situation will not help and will bring things to an even worse level,\u201d warned Diane Abbott, an opposition Labor Party lawmaker from the hard-hit London neighborhood of Hackney.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut underscoring how deeply the riots had rocked this nation, lawmakers across the political spectrum were condemning the role of social media in the riots, calling for a way to blunt their use as tools of violence.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRampaging youths, authorities say, used BlackBerry Messenger, Twitter, Facebook and other social media to organize disturbances, sharing meeting times and locations and, in some cases, openly calling for the spread of criminality. BlackBerry Messenger, which does not charge for text messages, was particularly popular among the largely poor youths who rioted.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOne BlackBerry text circulating in London on Monday night urged rioters to pour into the Enfield neighborhood of north London, where a Sony distribution center was set ablaze. Another text called on rioters to attack stores in the famous shopping district of Oxford Circus: \u201cEveryone run wild, all of London and others are invited! Pure terror and havoc & Free stuff. Just smash shop windows and cart out da stuff u want!\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut there were also comments, including several on Facebook, that rather than organizing riots, simply spoke out in their support. It\u2019s unclear whether those would be seen as inciting violence and thus be targets of a British government campaign.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThe riots are 4 us to show the police that they cnt bully us,\u201d said one posting on the Facebook page of a user named Priceless King.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExperts warn, however, of technical issues in blocking or interpreting encrypted BlackBerry instant messages, which operate on a special network. Theresa May, Britain\u2019s home secretary and the minister in charge of policing, said she would meet with representatives from social media companies to come up with a plan, though the government appeared to be testing the waters of public opinion before pressing ahead. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay said, however, that social media have clearly been used \u201cto coordinate criminality and stay one step ahead of the police.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBlackBerry officials would not directly comment on the government\u2019s announcement. But the company said in a statement: \u201cAs in all markets around the world where BlackBerry is available, we cooperate with local telecommunications operators, law enforcement and regulatory officials.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut student activists \u2014 including those who in December helped organize a political protest against budget cuts that turned violent after a breakaway group vandalized central London businesses \u2014 decried the move as a full-on attack on freedom of expression. They questioned whether such measures would be used against them as well, warning that the government could be going down a dangerous road toward silencing voices of social dissent. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThis puts Cameron in very poor company internationally,\u201d said Martin Young, 22, who took part in the December student protests. \u201cThis is the same reaction by the Middle East and North African governments, which we condemned for having no respect for privacy and freedom of communications.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfaiolaa@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpecial correspondent Rebecca Omonira-Oyekanmi contributed to this report.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 15:37:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomworldeuropebritain-weighs-personal-freedoms-against-need-to-keep-order20110811giqamtos8i_storyhtmlwprssrss_business"}}, {"pk": 11, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 09:56:11", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:18", "headline": "Featured Advertiser", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/4e8c52c182fe25ea9f4c971da6ee8449", "content": "<a href=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/click.phdo?s=4e8c52c182fe25ea9f4c971da6ee8449&amp;p=4\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/img.phdo?s=4e8c52c182fe25ea9f4c971da6ee8449&amp;p=4\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 15:12:00", "guid": "false", "slug": "httpfeedswashingtonpostcomrss4e8c52c182fe25ea9f4c971da6ee8449"}}, {"pk": 13, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 09:56:11", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:18", "headline": "Michele Bachmann\u2019s inaccurate recounting of the debt-ceiling saga", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/michele-bachmanns-inaccurate-recounting-of-the-debt-ceiling-saga/2011/08/10/gIQAKbvE7I_blog.html?wprss=fact-checker", "content": "<p></p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cWhat we saw last week is the markets unfortunately agreed with me.

The challenge for Romney will be to swiftly quench whatever fire comes his way and pivot to his core argument that he alone has the skills and experience to beat President Obama and fix the nation\u2019s sputtering economy. Romney will try to avoid getting dragged into a fight over his past \u2014 whether it\u2019s his Massachusetts health care law or his jobs record as governor or his experience in private equity where he oversaw both the growth and downsizing of companies. Instead of litigating his record on the debate stage, Romney will try to use attacks on him as opportunities to talk about how he would steer the country in the future. His challenge is to show more command over the economy than his rivals and draw an alignment in the minds of voters between his candidacy and reviving the economy. Romney\u2019s advisers said each of his statements at the debate need to add up to the core message of why he is running for president and why he thinks he can be the best Republican nominee. He needs to avoid any gaffes or mistakes that could knock him from his frontrunner perch.

The official count ratified the notion that Washington is a growing, dynamic city, with the population ticking up over the previous decennial count for the first time since 1950. But the numbers could be better. The District last month joined at least 47 other jurisdictions in lodging an official challenge to its census count. Official documents indicate that the city is the largest polity to do so, but there were reports on Wednesday that New York City has also filed a challenge. The city successfully challenged its 2005 estimate upward by more than 31,000. City planning director Harriet Tregoning said not to expect such a big boost this time.

Cloning humans, even. Caning teen vandals. Believing that aliens have descended from space and abducted humans. These are all things that, at one time or another, have enjoyed more public backing than Congress is getting right now. Even President George W. Bush, at his lowest of lows during the 2008 financial crisis, was more popular than the men and women who currently occupy Capitol Hill. Ragging on Congress, with its sluglike reaction times and inspiring displays of public bickering, has long been a favorite national pastime. But recent polls indicate that Congress\u2019s approval ratings have sunk to all-time lows. Which is pretty bad for an outfit that\u2019s been around since 1787. A recent CNN poll found that just 14 percent of Americans surveyed approved of how Congress has been doing its job. And a new Washington Post poll found that only 17\u00a0percent of Americans surveyed thought their representative should be reelected in 2012. \u201cThese are notably low,\u201d said Charles Stewart III, a political scientist at MIT. Stewart said Congress might possibly have been even less popular during the days leading up to the Civil War, or during the less-remembered political upheavals of the 1880s and \u201990s. But it has never been rated lower since the advent of widespread public polling on Congress, which Stewart dated to the 1970s, than it has been in recent days. \u201cIt\u2019s undoubtedly reflecting a generalized disgust with the institution,\u201d he said. For a little comparison, a 1997 ABC poll found that 39 percent approved of cloning sheep. Pollsters for Johns Hopkins University found in 2002 that 18 percent approved of human cloning. A survey from Gallup in June showed that Americans have more confidence in banks and even HMOs than in Congress. And Americans, as polled by CNN in 1997, were 3\u20091/2 times as likely to believe in alien kidnappings than they now are to approve of Congress. And 37 percent of respondents told the Los Angeles Times in 1994 that they thought it was a good idea to cane teen vandals, after an 18-year-old was famously sentenced to a beating in Singapore. There was no available information on what percentage of Americans think it\u2019s a good idea to cane members of Congress \u2014 or to abduct them. The causes of the revulsion are both obvious and bedeviling: a constitutional system set up to promote divided and gridlocked government. General anxiety about a lagging world economy that makes Congress\u2019s clashes appear even more reckless. A media environment that caters to partisans and spotlights conflict. And, maybe most important, a political class that reflects real and deep divisions among the people it represents about the proper size and scope of government. \u201cIf the Constitution was designed to create gridlock, and we\u2019ve discovered the Congress and the president are in gridlock now, who should we really blame here?\u201d Stewart asked. But that doesn\u2019t mean Congress couldn\u2019t give image improvement a try. Second chances are quintessentially American, and there are tons of examples of hated companies and personalities who have successfully turned things around that Congress could look to for inspiration. Toyota appears to be successfully rebounding from a series of reputation-damaging recalls. Michael Vick is back on top after serving time in prison for his involvement with a dog-fighting ring. Few people even remember that Tylenol\u2019s image once took a hit after seven people died in 1983 from ingesting pills that had been poisoned, without the company\u2019s knowledge, with cyanide. Public relations managers say the keys to a turnaround are easy to explain, though not necessarily easy to replicate: Be humble. Apologize. Most important, examine why your reputation has tanked and make real changes to address it. These are not traits most people readily associate with politicians. \u201cIt can\u2019t be window dressing,\u201d said Jesse Derris, a crisis consultant for the public relations firm Sunshine Sachs. \u201cWhen you have a truly successful rehabilitation effort, there\u2019s substance behind it.\u201d Derris would not discuss his clients, but he has been publicly identified as a spokesman for the chief executive of Merrill Lynch during the 2008 market crash; the New York Jets; and Disney star Demi Lovato. He said that from athletes to movie stars, there\u2019s always one tried-and-true route to image improvement: Do your job well, and then keep at it. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a one-off,\u201d Derris said. \u201cWhatever happens has to be sustained.\u201d Part of Congress\u2019s problem is that some of the tried-and-true tactics employed by companies and personalities are inaccessible. Congress can\u2019t re-brand itself by changing its name or mission statement, which has been pretty well established for the past couple of hundred years. Congress\u2019s stakeholders could oust its management or employees. But the public has tried that route repeatedly, including last year, and doesn\u2019t appear satisfied with the results. Nick Ragone, director of the Washington office of communications firm Ketchum, said he will sometimes advise corporate clients seeking to improve their image to go hyper-transparent, to overcommunicate about their strategy. But, he said, Congress\u2019s problem is that Americans have been watching lawmakers do their job for the past several weeks more closely than usual. And they don\u2019t like what they\u2019ve seen. Hyper-transparency, it would seem, only hurts Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird paradox,\u201d he said. \u201cThe counsel we\u2019d give clients is not available here.\u201d There is one thing that could work: time. James A. Stimson, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina, has found that approval of both the president and Congress has always risen and fallen with the economy. Stimson said this Congress has hurt its cause through months of public gridlock. But he said that when the economy rebounds, public approval probably will, too. \u201cCongress will never be popular,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be less unpopular.\u201d heldermanr@washpost.com craighillp@washpost.com Staff writer David A.

But S&P also seeks to influence the U.S. government in a more traditional way: financing aggressive lobbying efforts aimed at limiting federal oversight and protecting its powerful role in financial markets. S&P\u2019s parent company, McGraw-Hill, has spent more than $11 million on lobbying over the past 15 years, including at least $1 million on S&P-related legislation, according to an analysis of federal disclosure records by the Sunlight Foundation. The firm\u2019s employees have also given more than $500,000 in contributions to federal candidates since 1989, primarily to Democrats, the analysis shows. The numbers underscore the unusual political position occupied by S&P and the country\u2019s two other top rating firms, Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Each company issues judgments on government creditworthiness that can move markets while  lobbying the government for policies favorable to its core businesses. Taken together, the three firms have spent more than $16 million on lobbying related to financial legislation over the past decade, including more than $13 million by Moody\u2019s alone, according to disclosure data. Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist for the Public Citizen advocacy group, said      S&P effectively serves a \u201cquasi-governmental\u201d function because of the power it has in shaping major economic policies. \u201cS&P wields a huge club over Congress and the president because the company can simply dictate public policies that have huge ramifications for the country and for the government,\u201d Holman said. \u201cIts influence over the government\u2019s purse can easily be employed as a powerful tool to win concessions from the federal government that are in S&P\u2019s own interest rather than the public\u2019s interest.\u201d  Officials with all three ratings companies say their financial analysts are cordoned off from lobbyists and other employees to ensure fair and unbiased judgments. \u201cOur analysts convey independent opinions about creditworthiness to the market using rigorous analytical criteria,\u201d McGraw-Hill spokeswoman Patricia Rockenwagner said in a statement, referring to S&P. \u201cOur lobbyists express views about public policy to the government. There is a strict firewall that separates the two \u2014 always has been, always will be.\u201d Michael N. Adler, vice president for corporate communications at Moody\u2019s, said the firm \u201cmaintains a strict separation between the commercial and analytical aspects of our business, and lobbying or other commercial activities do not play any role in the ratings process.\u201d Fitch spokesman Daniel Noonan said lobbying efforts \u201care completely separate from and have zero influence upon our analytical groups that assign ratings.\u201d  S&P announced Friday that it was lowering its rating for U.S. debt from AAA to AA+, saying that \u201cpolitical brinksmanship\u201d in the debate over the U.S. debt ceiling had called into doubt the nation\u2019s ability to manage its finances. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner sharply criticized the firm for \u201cterrible judgment\u201d and said the company had made a $2 trillion error in its draft report on the issue. Moody\u2019s and Fitch have not lowered their AAA ratings, and investors have continued to embrace U.S. bonds amid widespread market volatility. The S&P decision also prompted a new round of criticism from Geithner and others about the firm\u2019s track record leading up to the 2008 financial crash. A Senate panel said  this year that the ratings agencies helped fuel the crisis by engaging in a profitable \u201crace to the bottom\u201d to prop up securities backed by subprime mortgages. Since then, S&P and the others have fought hard on Capitol Hill to kill or limit legislation aimed at increasing scrutiny of their work. For example, the firms are working to undo a portion of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that removed protections barring lawsuits against the ratings firms for negligence. Federal regulators are also preparing to write rules aimed at reducing the heavy influence of the companies in the debt securities markets. The firms employ well-connected lobbyists to carry out their efforts. S&P\u2019s roster, for example, includes Democratic superlobbyist Tony Podesta and Douglas Nappi, who previously worked for the Senate Banking Committee and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  \u201cThese agencies occupy a fairly unique position in Washington compared to a regular financial firm,\u201d said Bill Allison, editorial director for the Sunlight Foundation, which tracks money in politics. \u201cThey seem to have been quite successful in forestalling oversight and maintaining their independence.\u201d eggend@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 10:40:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsthe-influence-industry-sandp-and-others-lobby-government-while-rating-its-credit20110809giqanbes6i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 170, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 1, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:08", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:08", "headline": "Google Plus adds games", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/faster-forward/post/google-plus-adds-games/2011/08/11/gIQAp18nAJ_blog.html?wprss=faster-forward", "content": "<p>Google Plus <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/games-in-google-fun-that-fits-your.html\">just got a little more fun.</a> The company announced Thursday that it\u2019s adding a games section to its fledgling social network, and is taking a different approach than its rival, Facebook.</p>\n<p>In the past, Facebook games have been criticized for spamming users with minute   updates on every little thing  going on at friends\u2019 virtual farms and cafes.

We accept with gratefulness an invitation to meet folks at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines this week. The heartland is perfect territory for more of the One Nation Tour as we put forth efforts to revitalize the fundamental restoration of America by highlighting our nation\u2019s heart, history, and founding principles.\u201d It was unclear when Palin would appear at the fair. A Palin spokesman did not immediately reply. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, the current GOP front-runner in the presidential race, is scheduled to campaign at the fairgrounds on Thursday. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) and former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty are due there Friday, and a slew of other candidates are planning to make the rounds, too. Palin is scheduled to return to Iowa over Labor Day weekend. She has said she is still weighing whether to jump into the presidential contest and indicated she would make her decision by September. In her e-mail, Palin said \u201cprudent Americans\u201d live within their means, including \u201cseeking affordable participation in more community events, local patriotic parades, and traditional all-American venues like state fairs.\u201d Palin added that she is \u201cexcited to try some of that famous fried butter-on-a-stick, fried cheesecake-on-a-stick, fried twinkies, etc. I\u2019ll enjoy them in honor of those who\u2019d rather make us just \u2018eat our peas\u2019!\u201d That was a reference to President Obama, who exhorted congressional leaders to \u201ceat  our peas\u201d in making tough choices during the recent debt debate.

The committee\u2019s report could ease the way for greater domestic gas exploration, even as it calls for new standards to limit harmful air emissions that bring to the surface gas buried deep in shale formations. But the report is largely silent on the most contentious issue surrounding shale gas exploration: who should regulate it, and whether regulators should apply to it laws such as the Safe Drinking Water Act. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping massive amounts of fluid \u2014 a mixture of water and chemicals \u2014 underground, which cracks the shale and drives the gas to the surface. With major deposits in several regions of the country, including  the Northeast and the Midwest, firms are tapping into the resource at an unprecedented rate. Shale gas accounted for less than 2\u00a0percent of total U.S. natural-gas production in 2001; it is now close to 30\u00a0percent, and the Energy Information Administration projects that it will amount to 45\u00a0percent of domestic production by 2035. As drilling activity has moved closer to residential areas \u2014 and as some researchers have found unusually high methane concentrations in nearby drinking water \u2014 local activists have called for a stop to further drilling. But industry officials, many politicians and some environmentalists have argued that the country must exploit a domestic energy source that does not release as much carbon dioxide as other fossil fuels when burned.  John Deutch, a chemistry professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who chaired the advisory panel, said in an interview that the group offered \u201ca different approach\u201d to overseeing fracking. \u201cYou measure, you disclose what you measure, and you use these measurements to improve the way you operate in the field and reduce your environmental impact,\u201d he said. Said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund and another panel member: \u201cIf the recommendations are adopted, shale gas resources in the United States will be tapped in a way that avoids some of the environmental problems that have cropped up so far, and minimizes and recognizes others.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is now a path for industry to act, and regulators to act, to avert the looming impasse over shale gas development.\u201d The group\u2019s recommendations will go to Energy Secretary Steven Chu, whose department does not regulate natural-gas production. But its advice, which covers potential actions by regulators and industry, could carry political weight because President Obama asked Chu to establish the advisory group. On Wednesday, the Environmental Working Group released a letter signed by 28 scientists objecting to the panel, noting that six of its members had connections to industry and that Deutch serves on the board of the natural-gas firm Cheniere Energy and was paid more than $1.4\u00a0million by that company and Schlumberger. between 2006 and 2009. Deutch said he fully disclosed his background before Chu selected him. The panel\u2019s report calls for full disclosure of the chemicals used in fracturing liquids, along with \u201cadoption of rigorous emission standards for both new and existing sources for methane, air toxics, ozone-forming pollutants and other major airborne contaminants,\u201d although it does not specify whether state or federal regulators should impose those rules. The Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates air and water quality, is conducting its own study of  fracking\u2019s effect on the environment and public health. EPA spokeswoman Betsaida Alcantara said that the agency is reviewing the panel\u2019s recommendations and that it will issue an initial report of its findings in 2012. The advisory panel emphasizes enhanced monitoring of fracking activities, including establishing a baseline for local water quality, studying the extent to which methane could migrate from drilling sites to nearby wells, and public disclosure of air pollution emissions from shale gas operations.  The report also stresses the importance of the industry adopting \u201cbest practices,\u201d a technique that offshore oil and gas operators have used for years, to ensure safe shale gas extraction. Shell, for example, issued principles in June aimed at setting a standard that the firms could follow, although it does not disclose all the elements in fracking fluid because suppliers say that doing so would disclose trade secrets. Although some of the group\u2019s recommendations would go further than rules that states have adopted for fracking \u2014 Texas, for instance, requires firms to disclose some but not all chemicals in fracking fluid \u2014 several of its proposals fall in line with what state and industry officials are already doing.  Industry experts such as Howard L. Boigon, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells who represents the oil and gas industry, said the report covers areas where operators \u201chave either been giving ground or are moving toward.\u201d  The Independent Petroleum Association of America said that \u201cthe report stands in stark contrast to the strident, hysterical demands for moratoria on hydraulic fracturing.\u201d But groups such as Friends of the Earth \u2014 which joined 67 other organizations in asking Obama on Monday to impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing \u2014 questioned why the panel would issue a report when the EPA was in the midst of a multi-year study. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about this 90-day rush to judgment that\u2019s just inappropriate,\u201d said Damon Moglen, who directs climate and energy policy for Friends of the Earth.  eilperinj@washpost.com Staff writer Steven Mufson contributed to this report.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 21:08:55", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomnationalhealth-scienceenergy-department-panel-to-endorse-shale-gas-exploration20110810giqaxqbh7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 126, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 13:26:10", "headline": "Ron Paul will hew to his Tea Party roots", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ron-paul-will-hew-to-his-tea-party-roots/2011/08/11/gIQAvHsj8I_story.html?wprss=rss_politics", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tRep.

It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been asked repeatedly over the last few days. I spoke to many very smart people in Silicon Valley \u2014 from big tech companies, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs \u2014 and what follows is some of what they had to say.\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst, let\u2019s address the big technology companies that provide most of the economic lift to the Valley. These multibillion-dollar global behemoths, such as Cisco Systems, Hewlett Packard, and Oracle have powered much of the Valley\u2019s growth during the past four decades. The people who run these tech titans are bracing for another recession. Tech spending had been in recovery mode, but customers won\u2019t buy more PCs, networking equipment or database software if they see their sales and revenues stagnating.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis refusal-to-buy goes not only for the U.S. but also for the rest of the globe, where growth seems to be leveling out in many of the fast-growing countries. A global slowdown, depending on its severity, will likely result in more tech layoffs and more economic pain for the Bay Area and the West Coast \u2014 where tech represents a disproportionate share of the economy. But not all tech titans are worried. Apple and Google both continue to grow smartly, driven by phenomenally popular smart phones and, in the case of Google, by companies\u2019 ongoing shift away from traditional advertising toward digital ads. But, by and large, big tech sees big stock market losses as reflective of weakening global confidence. And that translates into weakened demand for tech products across the board.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVenture capitalists, the apex predators of Silicon Valley, are far more worried than the tech titans. The economic meltdown after the fall of Lehman Bros. decimated the venture capital industry, with many well-known funds holding onto underwater portfolios and thousands of venture capital jobs vanishing into thin air. Mark Suster, a venture capitalist and respected blogger,\u00a0painted an ugly picture when he wrote about what was likely going on in Monday morning meetings at venture capital funds around the world. In his view, the venture capital bull market is ending and inflated venture capital portfolios, filled with social media and game startups, will lose value quickly. The IPO window that briefly opened for LinkedIn, Pandora and Zillow, among other Web startups, will slam shut, according to Suster. And VCs will remove their horns, resign themselves to an environment of tough fundraising, and focus efforts on their most promising companies.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAll of this will barely make a dent in the consciousness of Silicon Valley\u2019s native tribe of eternal optimists \u2014 the tech entrepreneurs. Eric Ries, a respected tech guru,\u00a0blogged that we are entering a \u201cwinter\u201d cycle for startup businesses. He says this is a good thing because those with true grit, with passion for their pursuit, with tenacity to build lean, profitable businesses through creative means will survive and thrive even as sources of funding dry up, valuations shrink, and they dig in for the long haul. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRies is right. A bout of winter could be a good thing. The Valley is overrun with \u201cme-too\u201d social media startups, many of which have received substantial funding in the hope that they will become the next Facebook or Twitter. The bursting of the social media bubble, when it happens, will inevitably force a reassessment of the value of companies in that realm. I predict that hundreds of these companies will shutter.\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is precisely the cycle of creative destruction \u2014 of bubble inflation and then popping  \u2014 that has fueled the innovation economy of Silicon Valley. From the rubble of these companies and business models will emerge newer, better ways of doing business and creating value. This bubble bursting will also diminish the corps of investment bankers and others who feed of the frenzy and get rich while providing little value in return. And that\u2019s another good thing, as entrepreneurs will focus less on financing and fundraising and more on profitability.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHistory has shown, time and again, that a bad economy is a good time to launch a business, since the lean times embed a lean, scrappy business DNA into a company. Great companies like Johnson & Johnson, Caterpillar, McDonald\u2019s, and Walt Disney were born in recessions \u2014 and sometimes even depressions. So were tech giants like Adobe, Intel, Compaq, Sun, and Microsoft. Nothing can stop innovation in Silicon Valley. Wall Street troubles, the political problems in Washington, and the staggering global economy will just make it easier for driven entrepreneurs to ignore the noise and focus on the innovation at the heart of their company and, over time, nurse the economy back to health.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWadhwa@duke.edu\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-12 05:28:22", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomnationalon-innovationssilicon-valleys-take-on-the-downgrade20110812giqaha0daj_storyhtmlwprssrss_business"}}, {"pk": 173, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:39", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:08", "headline": "Pawlenty, Bachmann spar early, often in GOP debate", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pawlenty-bachmann-spar-early-often-in-gop-debate/2011/08/11/gIQAt8ar9I_story.html?wprss=rss_politics", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tAMES, Iowa \u2014 The last vestiges of \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d fell by the wayside during a Republican debate here Thursday night, as the two candidates who have the most at stake in Iowa went after each other in the roughest exchange thus far in the race for the 2012 presidential nomination.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cLook, she has done wonderful things in her life, absolutely wonderful things, but it is an undisputable fact that in Congress her record of accomplishment and results is nonexistent,\u201d former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty said of Rep. Michele Bachmann, who represents his state.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThen it was Bachmann\u2019s turn. \u201cWhen you were governor in Minnesota you implemented cap and trade in our state and you praised the unconstitutional individual mandates and called for requiring all people in our state to purchase health insurance that the government would mandate,\u201d she retorted. \u201cYou said the era of small government was over. That sounds more like Barack Obama, if you ask me.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe denied her charges, saying \u201cshe\u2019s got a record of misstating and making false statements.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTheir exchange underscored the fact that neither of the neighboring-state politicians can afford to lose the first-in-the-nation contest that will be held here six months from now \u2014 and that each poses the greatest threat to the other\u2019s hopes in Iowa.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEven beyond the sparring between the two Minnesotans, the debate was the most contentious gathering of Republican candidates to date. It came at a pivotal moment of the race, two days before the Ames Straw Poll, a state party fundraiser that is an early test of campaign organization and voter enthusiasm. The straw poll has been an uncertain predictor of which candidate will prevail, but has in the past crushed the hopes of those who fall below expectations.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPawlenty and Bachmann were among eight candidates on stage, though their drama defined the evening and is likely to reverberate in the coming days. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAll were also shadowed by the presence of two figures who were not there: Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has indicated that he is about to announce his presidential bid, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who will continue her flirtation with a 2012 run by making a trip to the state on Friday.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe third formal debate of the campaign season was the first appearance onstage by former Utah governor and ambassador to China Jon Huntsman Jr. The others were former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who is presumed to be the front-runner; libertarian congressman Ron Paul (R-Texas); former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.); Herman Cain, who was chief executive of Godfather\u2019s Pizza, and ex-House speaker Newt Gingrich.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor Pawlenty, the debate also represented an opportunity to try to recover from his greatest misstep thus far. In the second debate on June 13 in New Hampshire, Pawlenty backed away from an attack he previously had leveled at Romney and the health-care system he had implemented in Massachusetts. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Massachusetts system became a model for the national one passed under President Obama, which conservatives deplore as a government takeover. And Pawlenty\u2019s unwillingness to confront Romney on it left many Republicans wondering whether he has what it takes to prevail in what promises to be a fierce contest against Obama.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPawlenty, given an opportunity for a do-over, said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to miss that chance again. Mitt, look \u2014 ObamaCare was patterned after Mitt\u2019s plan in Massachusetts. .\u2009.\u2009. That\u2019s why I called it Obamneycare, and I think that\u2019s a fair label.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRomney laughed and said: \u201cI like Tim\u2019s answer at the last debate better.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut Romney added, as he has in the past: \u201cWe put together a plan that was right for Massachusetts. The president took the power of the people and the states away from them and put in place a one-size-fits-all plan.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOtherwise, however, Romney largely escaped the kind of criticism that is normally leveled by the other candidates at the frontrunning contenders during these kinds of forums.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, Gingrich fought repeatedly with one of the moderators, Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace, who questioned why the former speaker\u2019s campaign \u201chas been a mess so far.\u201d Gingrich accused Wallace of asking \u201cgotcha questions\u201d and \u201cplaying Mickey Mouse games.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAll the candidates found their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and past positions on display. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHuntsman was put on the defensive repeatedly, as he was challenged over his support for civil unions, his service in the Obama administration and his family business\u2019s record of sending jobs overseas.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, he noted that, during his administration, Utah had led the nation in job creation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWhen you look at me and you ask what is that guy going to do, look at what I did as governor,\u201d Huntsman said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRomney, meanwhile, emphasized not his record as governor, but his experience in the private sector turning around struggling companies. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe noted only he and Cain had extensive private-sector experience, and added: \u201cLet me tell you about how the real economy works.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBachmann and Pawlenty argued over whether championing change or achieving it matters more.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cI have a very consistent record of fighting very hard against Barack Obama and his unconstitutional measures in Congress,\u201d Bachmann said. \u201cThat is what qualifies me, as a fighter and representative of the people, to go to Washington, D.C., and to the White House. People are looking for a champion. They want someone who has been fighting.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPawlenty, meanwhile, contended that Bachmann\u2019s has been a record that is long on rhetoric, but empty of achievement. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cShe fought for less government spending, we got a lot more. She led the effort against ObamaCare, we got ObamaCare. She led the effort against [the 2008 Troubled Assets Relief Program, which bailed out Wall Street], we got TARP,\u201d Pawlenty said. \u201cIf that\u2019s your view of effective leadership with results, please stop, because you\u2019re killing us.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSantorum also leveled criticism at Bachmann, saying her opposition to raising the debt ceiling amounted to \u201cshowmanship, not leadership,\u201d and put the country at risk of default.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOne tense moment came when Bachmann was asked about an earlier recollection, in which she said she had studied tax law because her husband, Marcus, had wanted her to, and that the Bible admonishes a wife to be submissive. Would that also apply in the White House, she was asked. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShe paused, as the audience booed the moderator.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cI\u2019m in love with him. I\u2019m so proud of him. And both he and I \u2014 what submission means to us, if that\u2019s what your question is, it means respect,\u201d she said. \u201cI respect my husband. He\u2019s a wonderful, godly man, and a great father. And he respects me as his wife. That\u2019s how we operate our marriage.\u2019\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaul was the only candidate who kept returning to foreign policy, and specifically, his opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cIt\u2019s time we quit this,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s time \u2014 it\u2019s trillions of dollars we\u2019re spending on these wars.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The dynamics of the race seem certain to shift with the entry of Perry, who has an establishment imprimatur as the nation\u2019s longest-serving governor, but who also has a populist bent that gives him strong appeal with the tea party.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEven as the other contenders were in their final hours of debate preparation here, Perry\u2019s nascent operation was quickly and aggressively revving up. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe are trying to get in the first million dollars of contributions very rapidly, to give the campaign its initial capital so important to get off the ground well,\u201d the campaign wrote in an e-mail to potential donors. \u201cIf you can send your own check in to us now, it will further that goal.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerry\u2019s campaign plans to hold fundraisers in nine cities between Aug. 20 and Sept. 1 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerry has indicated that he will announce his candidacy on Saturday at a speech before the RedState Gathering, a conservative event, in South Carolina. He will campaign in New Hampshire later that evening, before making a three-day swing through Iowa.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerry will not be the only distraction from the officially sanctioned Iowa GOP events. Palin announced Wednesday night that she \u2014 and her enormous tour bus \u2014 will be making an impromptu visit to the Iowa state fair. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAll of that may well tamp down any bounce that the winner of the Iowa straw poll might otherwise enjoy.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead more on PostPolitics.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFact checking the GOP debate in Iowa\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichele Bachmann: Still standing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGOP debate kicks campaign into new phase\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttumultyk@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\truckerp@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 19:33:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticspawlenty-bachmann-spar-early-often-in-gop-debate20110811giqat8ar9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 174, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:08", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:08", "headline": "Fact checking the GOP debate in Iowa", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-gop-debate-in-iowa/2011/08/11/gIQAH9PAAJ_blog.html?wprss=fact-checker", "content": "<p></p>\n<p>That was some collection of facts and statistics during the GOP debate in Iowa on Friday night that aired on Fox News.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re going to take an instant stab at nine of the statements, and then perhaps come back next week with a more extended look at other assertions.

As the housing crisis has persisted, government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, along with the Federal Housing Administration, have taken possession of hundreds of thousands of foreclosures throughout the country. But selling those homes at decent prices in an abysmal market has proven difficult. That quandary led the Treasury Department, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (which oversees Fannie and Freddie) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development on Wednesday to put out a \u201crequest for information\u201d seeking imaginative ways to clear the backlog, particularly by turning foreclosed properties into rentals. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we support the process of repair and recovery in the housing market,\u201d Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in a statement. \u201cExploring new options for selling these foreclosed properties will help expand access to affordable rental housing, promote private investment in local housing markets and support neighborhood and home price stability.\u201d Officials said they are hoping to identify private-sector partners that could purchase pools of foreclosed properties and turn them into rental units. If successful, the effort could help the government clear the backlog on its books, meet increasing rental demands and help relieve pressure on local housing prices. The agencies said they expect to hear from a range of stakeholders, including financial firms, companies with property management expertise, community groups, academics and even local governments and nonprofits. They said they aren\u2019t searching for a single, monolithic approach for the entire country, but rather solutions that make sense for individual regions with different housing challenges. The deadline to submit ideas is Sept. 15. The public-private partnerships \u201cmay reduce taxpayer losses\u201d and \u201cbring stability and liquidity to housing markets,\u201d FHFA acting Director Edward DeMarco said in a statement. Since taking office, President Obama has searched for ways to get the housing market back on its feet. Despite efforts to help struggling homeowners modify their loans and avoid foreclosures, the sluggish market and persistent unemployment perpetuated the stream of delinquencies and foreclosures. Fannie and Freddie have depended on government aid since they were seized in 2008, relying on more than $150 billion in taxpayer assistance so far. Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former Obama economic adviser, called the new effort a \u201ccommon sense\u201d  attempt to improve the housing market. He acknowledged that there are \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d about whether taxpayers might get a bad deal if the properties are sold to investors at steep discounts and whether the investors buying the foreclosures might turn out to be lousy landlords. But Bernstein said that the government already is being forced to sell repossessed properties at low prices because of the oversupply of homes on the market, and that turning a portion into rentals could actually help alleviate downward pressure on home values. He also said the government would need to vet the new owners, require that they meet standards for maintaining the properties and make sure they are managing the rentals effectively. \u201cI don\u2019t want to create the impression this is some kind of silver bullet,\u201d Bernstein said, noting previous administration efforts that have fallen short of initial goals. \u201cBut it helps.\u201d One other advantage? No congressional approval needed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go through Congress, which means you might actually be able to do it,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cIf you like this idea, and I do, that\u2019s the biggest upside because it means it can actually come to fruition.\u201d dennisb@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 17:14:15", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcombusinesseconomygovernment-owned-homes-may-get-for-rent-signs20110810giqaxxam7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 26, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:18", "headline": "The Rick Perry that Texans know", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-perry-texans-know/2011/08/09/gIQAC1H14I_story.html?wprss=rss_politics", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tDES MOINES The biggest guessing game in Republican politics today is what kind of presidential candidate Texas Gov. Rick Perry would be. Is he a heavyweight ready to contend seriously for the nomination, or someone who stumbles when he steps onto the big stage? His prospective candidacy looms large over the GOP race. Without much effort on his part, other than a few strategic appearances and a powerful echo chamber, Perry is already being cast as the most likely candidate to challenge Mitt Romney\u2019s standing as the front-runner for the party\u2019s nomination. If that\u2019s the case, Mark McKinnon, who was a top adviser to President George W. Bush, has a warning for the former Massachusetts governor. \u201cI think he will put Romney in the microwave and turn it up to high,\u201d he said. \u201cRomney\u2019s been avoiding the heat so far, but not when Perry gets in.\u201d That is the most colorful way of saying what a number of Texans who have watched Perry closely over the years agree on, which is that he has proved to be a skilled and disciplined candidate with an instinct for where the base of his party stands and a style on the stump that is as aggressive as it is conservative. Paul Burka, the veteran political writer for Texas Monthly, recently wrote an article called \u201cDear Yankee.\u201d It was a plea for all the Northern reporters from national publications who will be making the pilgrimage to Austin not to deal in old and foolish stereotypes in assessing Perry \u2014 or Texas. Burka, who has come to understand Perry\u2019s strengths and weaknesses as well as anyone in the state, had much to say of value. Among other things, he noted that the governor with the big head of hair should not be dismissed as a \u201csoft or feckless\u201d pretty boy, as if he were a Republican version of the Democratic Breck Boy, John Edwards. \u201cPerry is a hard man,\u201d Burka wrote. \u201cHe is the kind of politician who would rather be feared than loved \u2014 or respected. And he has gotten his wish. Perry does not have many friends in the [Texas] Legislature.\u201d Asked what non-Texans may understand least about Perry, McKinnon said: \u201cWhat they don\u2019t know is that he\u2019s probably much more tested than people think. He\u2019s been through some very, very tough campaigns. He\u2019s pretty battle-tested. The national scene is a different deal, but he is a vigorous, aggressive, disciplined campaigner \u2014 and knuckles-out.\u201d He has never lost an election and as a Republican he has never hugged the center \u2014 a potential problem in a general election but not in the primary of the current Republican Party. Instead he has developed near-perfect pitch with the party\u2019s conservative base. He has what another Texan calls \u201can instinctual read\u201d on the Republican Party, something few people say about Romney. Perry sounded the tea party\u2019s bugle even before most people understood what a force that movement would become within the Republican Party. When he talked about secession back in 2009, Democrats saw it as a blunder by a lightweight. But it resonated with conservatives fed up with Washington. There is wide agreement in Texas political circles that it was his instinct for where the party was moving at the time, along with his attack politics, that made it possible for him to demolish Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in their 2010 gubernatorial primary, a race that only a year earlier appeared to be hers to lose. \u201cHe obliterated her with his anti-Washington message,\u201d said Matthew Dowd, who was a top adviser in both of Bush\u2019s presidential campaigns. \u201cHe\u2019s honed that, and that\u2019s going to be a big part of who wins the Republican race.\u201d Many people may wonder whether the country, or the Republican Party, is ready for another Texan. Those who know Perry, however, say that he is not George W. Bush. It\u2019s well known that there is little love between the Bush and Perry camps, but personal relationships aside, the two have approached governing in the Lone Star State with divergent styles. \u201cBush by nature, in Texas, wanted to be a conciliator,\u201d said one Texas strategist, who requested anonymity to give a candid assessment of Perry. \u201cI think he wanted to be somewhat bipartisan. I don\u2019t think Perry\u2019s particularly interested in those things. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s afraid to be partisan. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s afraid to be tough and mean when he has to.\u201d After switching parties in the late 1980s, Perry decided to move hard to the right, doing what he could to outflank conventional Republicans almost from Day One. That conservatism, say other Texans, is real and deeply ingrained. Perry\u2019s conservatism is not of the compassionate kind that ushered Bush onto the national stage in the 2000 campaign. When he\u2019s been asked the impact of Texas\u2019s low-tax, low-service environment on the poor, he\u2019s dismissed the question by saying that if people want a heavy hand of government, they should look to California or New York for inspiration. His appearance at the prayer service in Houston on Saturday shows his capacity to speak authentically to religious conservatives. His anti-Washington message resonates with tea party activists. The Texas economy gives him a record to talk about that will play well with the Chamber of Commerce wing of the party. For all that, there are still questions that surround his likely candidacy. He has the discipline, but does he have the stamina for a long campaign? He has been examined by Democrats and the Texas media but will undergo a vetting unlike anything he\u2019s seen in the past. How will he react to the inevitable stories critical of him, his record, his policies, his exercise of power and his connections? Perry makes a strong first impression. He knows his message and sticks to it \u2014 and sticks to it and sticks to it and sticks to it. That can be an asset or, if it appears he doesn\u2019t have answers beyond his main message, a potential liability. What he will be like in debates and on the Sunday shows is another question. He avoided debates in the last campaign and also declined to sit for interviews with editorial boards, saying he knew he wasn\u2019t going to get their endorsements so it wasn\u2019t worth bothering. If he gets into the race later this month, he\u2019ll face three debates in September alone. Burka and others point to another characteristic: Perry has been lucky. \u201cIf you look at Perry\u2019s career,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit seems that fate is always arranging the universe so that its favorite son will be in the right place at the right time.\u201d Is this another time? Or by sometime this fall, will Rick Perry be remembered as some of his Texas predecessors, John Connally and Phil Gramm among them, as a candidate who came into the race with high expectations but who never found his footing or his audience? Texans say Perry has been underestimated many times. But he\u2019s never faced what will await him if he does jump in.

The regulations require fuel-efficiency improvements of as much as 23 percent by model year 2018, compared with the industry\u2019s 2010 baseline. The administration estimates that the rules will save a total of $50\u00a0billion in fuel costs and 530\u00a0million barrels of oil during that period.  Heavy-duty trucks and buses account for 20\u00a0percent of the nation\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions. Federal officials said the stricter limits will increase the cost of a tractor-trailer by $6,220 while saving $73,000 in fuel costs over the operating life. The regulations were welcomed by trucking industry officials, a response unlike that received by recently announced fuel-efficiency standards for passenger cars and light trucks, which prompted a contentious behind-the-scenes battle in Washington.  \u201cWhile we were working to improve the efficiency of cars and light-duty trucks, something interesting happened,\u201d President Obama said in a statement. \u201cWe started getting letters asking that we do the same for medium and heavy-duty trucks. They were from the people who build, buy, and drive these trucks. And today, I\u2019m proud to have the support of these companies as we announce the first-ever national policy to increase fuel efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas pollution from medium-and heavy-duty trucks.\u201d  With this regulation, all classes of U.S. vehicles now must meet some fuel efficiency standard. Before making the announcement, Obama met for a half-hour in the Roosevelt Room with more than a half-dozen industry representatives, including Bill Graves, president and chief executive of the American Trucking Associations, and Jed Mandel, president of the Engine Manufacturers Association.  \u201cEveryone was sort of patting everyone else on the back,\u201d Graves said in a phone interview, adding that his members are confident that they will be able to buy vehicles that meet the new requirements. \u201cEverybody knows what the expectations are, and everyone has lead time to meet those expectations. .\u2009.\u2009. I honestly believe one of the reasons we the users have confidence in this rule is we know how competitive these truck manufacturers, engine manufacturers are.\u201d Industry officials predicted that they will meet the new standards without a problem. Douglas W. Stotlar, president and chief executive of the freight transportation company Con-way Inc., called it \u201ca realistic solution that will ultimately help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve natural resources by helping to increase the fuel efficiency of our industry.\u201d  Tim Solso, chairman and chief executive of Cummins Inc., the world\u2019s largest independent manufacturer of diesel engines, said, \u201cHaving a clear set of standards allows us to invest in technologies that we will use not only here in the United States but globally.\u201d Environmentalists also hailed the new rules \u2014 issued jointly by the Transportation Department and the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 as a step forward in reducing the nation\u2019s carbon output. Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in an e-mail that the U.S. fleet of trucks and buses \u201cconsumes nearly 2.5\u00a0million barrels of oil per day\u201d and that the regulation would \u201ccut climate pollution by 270 million metric tons.\u201d \u201cU.S. engine makers in the heartland of our nation have world class products that will help break our addiction to foreign oil, save Americans hard earned money through more fuel efficient engines, cut dangerous pollution, and expand clean technology exports,\u201d Patton wrote.  Under the new limits, fuel efficiency for one type of tractor-trailer \u2014  a big rig with a  \u201chigh roof sleeper cab\u201d \u2014 would improve about 23 percent by 2018, and average miles per gallon would rise from 6 to 7.2.  Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, said in an interview that the rules were significant because \u201cit\u2019s the first time globally a country has set efficiency standards for the full heavy-duty vehicle.\u201d Japan set standards for heavy-duty truck engines in 2006 but did not address parts that included the vehicles\u2019 transmission and tires. Setting the next round of standards, which would probably cover the trailing equipment pulled behind the trucks, could prove more difficult. Graves said that truckers expect fuel savings from the new rules will make up for the higher cost of equipment within two to three years but that it will be harder when trailers are \u201cadded to the mix.\u201d eilperinj@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-09 11:23:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomnationalhealth-scienceadministration-sets-fuel-efficiency-rules-for-heavy-duty-trucks-and-buses20110809giqan4zv4i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 30, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Most Virginia schools labeled as failing under federal law", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/most-virginia-schools-labeled-as-failing-under-federal-law/2011/08/11/gIQAAZpn8I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tAt least three in five Virginia schools failed to meet annual benchmarks under the federal No Child Left Behind law, a dramatic increase in the failure rate that education leaders attribute to \u201carbitrary\u201d rules that \u201cmisidentify\u201d schools, state officials said Thursday.  Sixty-two percent of Virginia\u2019s public schools fell short of testing goals in math and reading, compared with 39\u00a0percent the year before, according to results released Thursday. All but four of the state\u2019s 132 school divisions, including all of those in Northern Virginia, also failed.  The exploding failure rate comes despite a decade of steady academic gains and overall passing rates close to or exceeding 90\u00a0percent statewide and throughout much of Northern Virginia. But under NCLB, the target passing rates for standardized tests increase each year in an effort to meet the federal law\u2019s goal of 100\u00a0percent proficiency in reading and math by 2013. Each subgroup of students based on race or disability status or poverty must also meet the same benchmark.  \u201cWhile this is a laudable goal \u2014 one we must continue to strive toward \u2014 it is not a basis for a workable accountability system,\u201d Patricia I. Wright, Virginia\u2019s superintendent of public instruction, said in a statement.  In Prince William County, the portion of schools that failed to meet testing benchmarks soared from 34\u00a0percent to 75\u00a0percent in the past year. And in Loudoun County, it grew from 34 to 57 percent. Fairfax County school officials declined to cite for publication the number of schools that failed to meet the testing goals, referred to as Adequate Yearly Progress. \u201cThis AYP thing has really lost its validity,\u201d said Paul Regnier, a spokesman for Fairfax County public schools. A review of state data shows that half fell short.  Among those schools in Fairfax that now carry a \u201cfailing\u201d label is Rachel Carson Middle School in Herndon, an academic powerhouse near the high-tech Dulles Corridor.  \u201cIt\u2019s bewildering to me \u2014 180 degrees from what I would expect,\u201d said Tami Holsten, whose daughter is a rising eighth-grader at Rachel Carson and whose son was one of more than 60 Carson graduates to be admitted to the intensely competitive Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology as a freshman last year.    This year, for a Virginia school to succeed, at least 86\u00a0percent of students had to show proficiency on state reading tests, and 85\u00a0percent had to pass state math tests. That\u2019s an increase from 81\u00a0and 79\u00a0percent respectively, from the year before.  Rachel Carson had an overall passing rate of 98\u00a0percent in English and 95\u00a0percent in math, but math scores for black students, Hispanic students, and students from low-income families were lower.  The sharp increase in the portion of schools being classified as failing was prophesied by Education Secretary Arne Duncan in March when he urged Congress to update the 2002 federal education law. Those efforts stalled, and Duncan, exercising his executive authority, announced Monday that he would allow states to apply for relief from the sanctions placed on schools that are labeled as failing. Wright said she will recommend that the Virginia Board of Education apply for a legal waiver, which is intended to give the state time to set up a new accountability system that would be based on how much students learn throughout the year, not just whether they pass or fail a test on one day.    In Maryland, 44\u00a0percent of elementary and middle schools were labeled as failing this summer. And in the District, 87\u00a0percent of the 187  public charter and traditional public schools fell short of benchmarks.   Each state gives different standardized tests and can determine different passing rates that schools need to achieve to succeed under the federal law. Virginia prides itself on holding itself to higher academic standards. \u201cOur schools are continuing to rise to the challenge, but that challenge keeps getting more difficult,\u201d said Jennifer Cassata, director of accountability  for Prince William County public schools. \u201cWe look at multiple measures for success. And we know these are not failing schools.\u201d   One area where many Virginia districts saw a drop in performance this year was for students with disabilities. Statewide passing rates in English dropped from 73\u00a0to 67\u00a0percent; passing rates for math dropped from 73\u00a0to 66\u00a0percent. Prince William and Loudoun counties and the City of Alexandria all had similar declines.    State and local officials said one reason for the drop in scores was the phasing out of a more flexible, alternative portfolio-style test that state lawmakers said was being overused and artificially inflating test scores.   A new computer test will be introduced over the next two years in math and reading that is intended to help students with disabilities who struggle to show what they have learned on a typical test. chandlerm@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 09:03:18", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaleducationmost-virginia-schools-labeled-as-failing-under-federal-law20110811giqaazpn8i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 180, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:08", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:08", "headline": "Economic confidence in Republicans and Obama drops sharply", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/behind-the-numbers/post/economic-confidence-in-republicans-and-obama-drops-sharply/2011/08/10/gIQA7kKy6I_blog.html?wprss=behind-the-numbers", "content": "<p>Americans report markedly less confidence in President Obama and congressional Republicans to make the right decisions about the country\u2019s economic future, according to a new <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/polls/postpoll_080911.html\">Washington Post poll conducted Wednesday night</a>.

Rick Perry will officially declare his candidacy Saturday, ending weeks of speculation and adding to the field a contender who could quickly shake up the race.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerry intends to make his campaign official on Saturday in South Carolina, according to his spokesman, Mark Miner. The governor will then travel to New Hampshire before heading to Iowa for several days of campaigning.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn Thursday, Perry weighed in on the rampant speculation about his possible 2012 bid, telling Time\u2019s Mark Halperin that he wants to be president.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cPart of it must be, I assume, whether or not you want to do it still,\u201d Halperin said. \u201cIs that still an open question?\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cYou and I having this conversation has answered that question,\u201d Perry responded. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn that interview, Perry stopped short of declaring his candidacy but rejected any notion that he couldn\u2019t compete with President Obama\u2019s formidable fundraising operation in the 2012 cycle,  which had already raised $86 million for himself and the Democratic National Committee as of June 30. \u201dI think [my operation] will be quite competitive in the fundraising side,\u201d he said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cI\u2019m kind of getting to the all-in point and the idea that this is what I\u2019m supposed to be doing,\u201d Perry told Halperin. \u201cI\u2019m very calm in my heart that this is what I\u2019m supposed to be doing.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, within minutes of Miner\u2019s announcement that the governor would run, Perry\u2019s campaign had sent out an e-mail fundraising blast, inviting major contributors to attend events in Texas cities and neighboring states at the end of August and beginning of September: Tulsa and Oklahoma City (Aug. 29);  Fort Worth and Dallas (Aug. 30); Austin, New Orleans and Houston (Aug. 31); and Midland, Texas, and San Antonio (Sept. 1).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThank you for being willing to contribute to Governor Perry\u2019s Presidential Campaign and raise money, [or] both. On behalf of our team, we are very, very grateful.\u201d says the e-mail. \u201cWe are trying to get in the first million dollars of contributions very rapidly, to give the campaign its initial capital so important to get off the ground well. If you can send your own check in to us now, it will further that goal.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe e-mail also warned recipients not to share information with opponents and the media.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cIt is imperative this email is not shared with anyone not a supporter of Governor Perry. We are trying to run a tight, disciplined \u2018ship,\u2019 with zero interaction with non-supporters or the media. Thank you for your full cooperation with this methodology,\u201d the e-mail read.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, a new independent group, billing itself as the top super political action committee supporting Perry\u2019s imminent campaign, is consolidating backers and getting its effort off the ground.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Make Us Great Again super PAC is bringing in Texas fundraisers Elizabeth Blakemore and Cynthia Wiedemann, who had previously been working with another pro-Perry super PAC, Americans for Rick Perry.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt will hold its first fundraisers next week in Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth, and it should be airing its first ad \u201csoon,\u201d according to a PAC source. Super PACs can raise and spend money in unlimited amounts and accept unlimited donations from wealthy donors, but they cannot coordinate with the candidates themselves.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the Time interview, Perry said his wife helped him reach the conclusion that he should be a candidate. \u201cThe issue of \u2018is this what I want to do?\u2019 was dealt with about 45 days ago in a conversation with my wife,\u201d Perry said.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe governor said Anita Perry, who is a nurse and whose father practiced medicine, was concerned about President Obama\u2019s health-care reforms. \u201cI mean we\u2019ve got one of the finest, if not the best, health care systems in the world. She sees Obamacare as destroying that,\u201d Perry told Halperin. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerry also recounted a conversation he had with former president George W. Bush in July, around the time that the media began speculating about a possible Perry candidacy. \u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019ll do what\u2019s right,\u2019\u2009\u201d Perry recounted of his conversation with the former president and former Texas governor. \u201cHe said you don\u2019t want to wake up when you\u2019re 70 and go, \u2018I wish I had tried that. I wish I had done that.\u2019\u2009\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPart of Perry\u2019s success in a race to which he has arrived late will depend on funding from super PACs. These entities, created after the Supreme Court case often referred to as Citizens United, are expected to play a large role in the 2012 presidential race. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Make Us Great Again effort backing Perry has signed up a team of prominent consultants, including Sacramento-based fundraiser Tony Russo, legal counsel Cleta Mitchell and the GOP advertising firm Jamestown Associates. It has also added staff that includes executive director Scott Rials and senior adviser Barry Bennett, who are both close to top Perry adviser David Carney.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe group surfaced this week in an e-mail from former Perry chief of staff Mike Toomey and supporter Brint Ryan, who will work with Russo to lead Perry\u2019s fundraising operation. It is one of seven super PACs that have been launched on behalf of Perry\u2019s nascent campaign, but organizers say they expect this PAC to be easily the biggest.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe e-mail from Toomey to potential donors that went public earlier this week quoted Toomey as saying donors should \u201cavoid any other group claiming to be \u2018the\u2019 pro-Perry independent effort.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnother former Perry aide, Dan Shelley, has launched two super PACs \u2013 Veterans for Rick Perry and the Jobs for Vets Fund. Americans for Rick Perry, which Blakemore and Wiedemann had been involved in, has been active early in Iowa.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe new effort aims to be the second major super PAC supporting a top GOP presidential campaign. Former Massaschusetts governor Mitt Romney\u2019s supporters have also formed a super PAC, Restore Our Future, which raised $12 million in the first half of 2012.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKaren Tumulty contributed to this story.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore on PostPolitics\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRomney: \u201cCorporations are people\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElizabeth Warren considering a Senate bid\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBachmann\u2019s debt ceiling baloney\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblakea@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarloweb@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 16:08:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsrick-perry-on-running-for-president-this-is-what-im-supposed-to-be-doing20110811giqaeuqj9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 182, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:08", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:08", "headline": "Gov.

The plan would require congressional approval but, if successful, could be precedent-setting, with possible ripple effects throughout government. It would also deliver a major blow to the nation\u2019s labor movement.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a notice informing employees of its proposals \u2014 with the headline \u201cFinancial crisis calls for significant actions\u201d \u2014 the Postal Service said, \u201cWe will be insolvent next month due to significant declines in mail volume and retiree health benefit pre-funding costs imposed by Congress.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDuring the past four years, the service lost $20 billion, including $8.5 billion in fiscal 2010. Over that period, mail volume dropped by 20 percent.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe USPS plan is described in two draft documents obtained by The Washington Post. A \u201cWorkforce Optimization\u201d paper acknowledges its \u201cextraordinary request\u201d to break its labor contracts.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cHowever, exceptional circumstances require exceptional remedies,\u201d the document says.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThe Postal Service is facing dire economic challenges that threaten its very existence. .\u2009.\u2009. If the Postal Service was a private sector business, it would have filed for bankruptcy and utilized the reorganization process to restructure its labor agreements to reflect the new financial reality,\u201d the document continues.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a white paper on health and retirement benefits, the USPS said it was imperative to rein in health benefit and pension costs, which are a third of its labor expenses.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor health insurance plans, the paper said, the Postal Service wanted to withdraw its 480,000 pensioners and 600,000 active employees from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program \u201cand place them in a new, Postal Service administered\u201d program.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlmost identical language is used for the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees Retirement System.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe USPS said the programs do not meet \u201cthe private sector comparability standard,\u201d a statement that could be translated as meaning that government plans are too generous and too costly.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cFEHB may exceed what the private sector does in certain areas,\u201d said Anthony J. Vegliante, USPS chief human resources officer and executive vice president. \u201cIt may not meet what the private sector does in other areas. So cost may be above the private sector, while value may be below the private sector.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBills that would rein in employee benefits or have workers pay more for the benefits have been introduced in Congress and met with vigorous opposition from federal employee organizations. Intentionally or not, the Postal Service\u2019s proposal provides support for such legislative initiatives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe proposals are the USPS\u2019s latest money-saving effort in a series of moves, some as recent as a few weeks ago and others stretching over a decade. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Postal Service has reduced its workforce by 212,000 positions in the past 10 years and recently announced it is considering the closing of 3,700 post offices. It also has asked Congress to allow it to deliver mail five days a week instead of six and to change a requirement that it pre-fund retiree health benefits.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe USPS said it needs to reduce its workforce by 120,000 career positions by 2015, from a total of about 563,400, on top of the 100,000 it expects by attrition. Some of the 120,000 could come through buyouts and other programs, but a significant number would probably result from layoffs if Congress allows the agency to circumvent union contracts.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cUnfortunately, the collective bargaining agreements between the Postal Service and our unionized employees contain layoff restrictions that make it impossible to reduce the size of our workforce by the amount required by 2015,\u201d according to the optimization document. \u201cTherefore, a legislative change is needed to eliminate the layoff protections in our collective bargaining agreements.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe layoff protection, however, does not apply to employees with fewer than six years of service, which presumably would include thousands of workers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPostal union leaders quickly and sharply rejected the plans.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThe APWU will vehemently oppose any attempt to destroy the collective bargaining rights of postal employees or tamper with our recently negotiated contract \u2014 whether by postal management or members of Congress,\u201d American Postal Workers Union President Cliff Guffey said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cOur advisers are not encouraging us at all to even consider it,\u201d said National Rural Letter Carriers\u2019 Association President Don Cantriel.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe are absolutely opposed\u201d to the layoff proposal, he said. \u201cWe are opposed to pulling out of the Federal Employees Health Benefits plan.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNational Association of Letter Carriers President Fredric V. Rolando said: \u201cThe issues of lay-off protection and health benefits are specifically covered by our contract. .\u2009.\u2009. The Congress of the United States does not engage in contract negotiations with unions, and we do not believe they are about to do so.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow Congress will respond to the proposals, however, remains to be seen. Many Republicans, including those who have sponsored legislation that labor considers anti-union, may support the plan. Some Democrats, for which organized labor is an ally, could back union opposition. But the Postal Service\u2019s critical financial situation could make some Democrats have second thoughts.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwo members of Congress who have introduced separate postal reform bills were noncommittal on the USPS plan.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA spokeswoman for Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) said, \u201cHe is particularly interested in learning whether these proposals would be fair to employees and effective in reducing the Postal Service\u2019s costs.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said: \u201cThese new ideas from the Postal Service are worth exploring. Options for reform and cost savings that will protect taxpayers from paying for a bailout, now or in the future, need to be on the table.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead more on PostPolitics.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Fed Page\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRomney: \u2018Corporations are people\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElizabeth Warren weighing Senate bid\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfederaldiary@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 17:24:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsusps-proposes-cutting-120000-jobs-pulling-out-of-health-care-plan20110811giqazxim9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 36, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "3 dead in Springfield, Virginia, crash", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/3-dead-in-springfield-virginia-crash/2011/08/10/gIQAMshW7I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tThree people are dead from a crash Wednesday in Springfield, including two men in a pickup truck that veered across a median, police said.

They urged the campaign front-runner to increase taxes on the wealthy to help fund such entitlement programs as Social Security and Medicare.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRomney explained that one way to fulfill promises on entitlement programs is to \u201craise taxes on people,\u201d but before he could articulate his position on not raising taxes, someone interrupted.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cCorporations!\u201d a protester shouted, apparently urging Romney to raise taxes on corporations that have benefited from loopholes in the tax code. \u201cCorporations!\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cCorporations are people, my friend,\u201d Romney said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome people in the front of the audience shouted, \u201cNo, they\u2019re not!\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cOf course they are,\u201d Romney said. \u201cEverything corporations earn ultimately goes to people.

In one case, a former girlfriend alleged that the man, Gary Giordano, stalked her, secretly videotaped them having sex and then posted pornographic images of her on the Internet, according to files in Montgomery County District Court. The woman sought and was granted a restraining order, court records show. No criminal charges were filed. \u201cShe was scared to death of the man,\u201d said the woman\u2019s attorney, Gail Landau. \u201cShe thought he was capable of great anger and violence.\u201d Giordano, 50, is being held in Aruba as authorities investigate the disappearance of 35-year-old Robyn Gardner, a Frederick County woman he was vacationing with on the island. Giordano reported that Gardner failed to return when the two went snorkeling, and a judge has ordered him held for questioning. Giordano has not been charged with a crime in Aruba. Aruban authorities have identified him only by his initials. But his lawyer there, Michael Lopez, identified the detained man as Giordano, according to the Associated Press. Lopez said that Giordano \u201cemphatically denies being involved in any malicious act concerning his friend and consequently does not consider himself a suspect,\u201d the Associated Press reported. Lopez did not return calls for comment. Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said that by early next week, authorities in Aruba will have to decide whether to start the process of bringing charges in the case. \u201cAt this point in time, there\u2019s discrepancies in his story, and we need to address them with him,\u201d Stein said. Giordano was not criminally charged in the Montgomery County matters, according to court records, and the allegations made by the two women were made in civil and family-law cases. In each case, Giordano filed allegations of his own, asserting that a former girlfriend harassed him by distributing slanderous letters and that his then-wife hit him in the upper back with a 14-inch steel cooking spoon. The most recent allegation of abuse against Giordano was filed Feb. 4 last year. The woman had met Giordano on the Internet about six months earlier, said Landau, the attorney. Then the woman found out that Giordano had secretly filmed the two having sex and posted intimate images of her on the Internet, Landau said in court filings in connection with the woman\u2019s restraining order. The woman confronted Giordano, who responded by placing indecent photos of her inside the mailboxes of about five of her neighbors, Landau said. The woman, who requested through her attorney that she not be named, swore to a similar account in court papers. She said Giordano once told her that \u201cthe world would be better off without\u201d her and that \u201che could help,\u201d according to filings. She also began speaking to Montgomery law enforcement, who searched Giordano\u2019s house in May last year, according to officials. But the case was ultimately halted. \u201cWe investigated Ms. Landau\u2019s client\u2019s matter and met with her multiple times,\u201d said Montgomery County State\u2019s Attorney John McCarthy, the county\u2019s top prosecutor. \u201cShe ultimately did not wish to pursue it, and we honored her wishes.\u201d  Landau said her client was afraid to pursue the case.  Steven Kupferberg, a Rockville lawyer who has represented Giordano in recent matters in Maryland, said that the allegations of secret sex videos were likely exaggerated. \u201cEverything concluded about a year ago,\u201d Kupferberg said, adding that it was resolved in Giordano\u2019s favor. \u201cI suspect that there wasn\u2019t anything to the allegations in terms of illegality.\u201d In the same case, Giordano alleged the woman had sent slanderous e-mails and letters to others about him. His application for a restraining order was denied by a judge on Feb. 4, 2010, according to court records. The judge granted the woman\u2019s request, and Giordano agreed to stay away from her and not contact her for six months, according to court records. Ten years ago, Giordano\u2019s wife at the time accused him of twice throwing their son on the ground, destroying a computer and throwing telephones. \u201cHe can\u2019t control his anger,\u201d she wrote. Giordano accused her of hitting him with the kitchen spoon and slapping him. He and his wife ultimately agreed to drop their requests for protective orders, according to court papers. They eventually divorced. Another woman who dated Giordano, Jeanette Farago, said in an interview with The Washington Post that Giordano stalked and harassed her while they both lived in Montgomery County. At one point, Farago said, Giordano offered to take her on a two-week cruise and bought her a ticket, but she refused to go.

Military officials had previously said 22 SEALs were among the dead.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThree of the men were Army reservists based near Gardner, Kan., where dozens gathered for a vigil last weekend. They had been working in a dangerous, high-octane environment, said a fellow soldier, Sgt. 1st Class Kirk Kuykendall.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe had served in Afghanistan with Chief Warrant Officer Bryan Nichols, who was piloting the Chinook helicopter when it was shot down. Kuykendall said Nichols had been involved in an earlier incident in June. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe were attempting to land 28 infantry soldiers in the middle of the night on a mountain,\u201d said Kuykendall, when a problem brought the helicopter down and Nichols had to steer it to a safe landing. Kuykendall broke his ankle in that crash and returned home.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cI know that it\u2019s because of Bryan Nichols that the rest of us who were on that helicopter were alive today,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was an up-and-coming superstar.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKuykendall also knew Spec. Alexander Bennett, a flight mechanic who died in Saturday\u2019s crash. Kuykendall trained Bennett in 2009, and they deployed together to Iraq before later going to Afghanistan.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe arrived in the first week of May, and the mission tempo was high, very high-stress,\u201d Kuykendall said. \u201c[Bennett] loved it, he wanted to stay another year. .\u2009.\u2009. The more dangerous the mission, the more he loved it.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpec. Spencer Duncan, from the same aviation regiment, was the door gunner on the helicopter that crashed. His death provoked intense grief in his home town, said family friend David Delgado, whose children used to play with the \u201coutgoing, polite\u201d Duncan at Indian Creek Church in Olathe, Kan.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cI know a lot of people are upset that we are having to lose our babies, or lose anybody, for this war,\u201d said Delgado, whose son serves in the Marine Corps. \u201cWe support our president, and we have to to remain a strong nation .\u2009.\u2009. but it\u2019s hurt the community.

Gray and Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier announced Wednesday. Homicides were down 11 percent and robberies down 7 percent through Aug. 1, Lanier said. In a joint news conference at the Mary Virginia Merrick Center in Southeast, the chief said that violent crime fell by an average of 37 percent in five neighborhoods that historically have had persistent crime problems. However, the statistics released Wednesday show that total crime in the District, including violent crime and property crime, was up by 3 percent through August. Gray (D) attributed the decreases to a summer effort to address such issues as abandoned cars, overgrown grass and youth crime. Beginning in May, Gray said, he directed city agencies to work together so that quality-of-life problems \u2014 including dirty playgrounds, dark alleys, and overgrown grass and weeds \u2014 were addressed \u201cwithin hours.\u201d Additionally, he said, residents have taken part in programs such as city-sponsored basketball and football games. Gray said the city\u2019s summer jobs program has also helped keep young people safe. Nobody under the age of 18 has been killed in the District since June 21, he said. Gray said that the collaborative strategy will continue year-round and that a report on the effectiveness of the summer effort will be released in the fall. labbet@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 16:35:57", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaldc-homicides-and-robberies-decline-though-overall-crime-is-up20110810giqab6kj7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 45, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Krupicka, Ebbin, Garvey vie in Northern Virginia\u2019s 30th Senate District", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/krupicka-ebbin-garvey-vie-in-northern-virginias-30th-senate-district/2011/08/07/gIQAngKK7I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tThis is part of a series on the Aug. 23 General Assembly primary elections in Northern Virginia. The series will appear in August.  Winning the Democratic primary for Virginia\u2019s blue-leaning 30th Senate District is up to the candidates. And their legs. And their knuckles. There\u2019s an off-year primary during the peak of vacation season \u2014 Aug. 23 \u2014 and there are virtually no policy differences among the three Democratic candidates. So the one who best woos voters by walking the district and knocking on the most doors will have a strong shot at replacing the soon-to-retire Patricia S. Ticer (D-Alexandria). \u201cWhat really matters to voters in a case like this .\u2009.\u2009. is just the chance to meet these people door- to-door,\u201d said Stephen Farnsworth, an expert on Virginia politics and an associate professor at George Mason University. \u201cThese races tend to go to those who work the hardest.\u201d And the Democratic candidates \u2014 Alexandria City Council member Rob Krupicka, Del. Adam P. Ebbin (Alexandria) and Arlington County School Board member Libby T. Garvey \u2014 are working hard. Republican candidate Tim McGhee, a church administrator, is running uncontested. \u201cIn these last two weeks, it\u2019s about reinforcing our message,\u201d Krupicka said. \u201cIt\u2019s about going back to the thousands and thousands of people we\u2019ve talked to and checking back with them one more time, and telling them where and how to go vote. This is a very grass-roots campaign, so it\u2019s going to end in a very grass-roots way.\u201d Krupicka touts his grass-roots experience as well as his work on the state Board of Education and the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts. Ebbin highlights his tenure in the General Assembly. \u201cMy experience will allow me to move across the hall to the Senate and be effective on Day One,\u201d he said. (He is giving up his House seat to run for the Senate.) Garvey said her background as a mother, widow and breast cancer survivor, as well as her work with the Council of Governments, makes her a good replacement for Ticer. If elected, Garvey would follow a long line of female Democratic legislators from Northern Virginia. \u201cI am absolutely confident I\u2019m meant to be in this race. I believe I should win this race,\u201d she said. \u201cI am pedal to the metal. I am working flat-out.\u201d In an interview, McGhee, the Republican, said he would work to uphold the U.S. and Virginia constitutions, as well as the general principles of life, liberty and justice. Although he hesitated to prioritize any single issue, he said he wanted to work on transportation issues and serve as a voice for those who find problems with the new federal health-care law. \u201cBy sticking to the fundamentals as I am and intend to do .\u2009.\u2009. it is a message that resonates with not only voters but people who [generally] want a good legislator,\u201d he said. McGhee is facing an uphill battle. Redistricting this year led to slightly more Republicans in the district, but experts say the move would probably not prevent a Democratic win. Money is another factor, observers said. The Democratic candidates have raised more than $170,000 each, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. McGhee has about $3,000 in the coffers. (He says he expects the fundraising to \u201cimprove greatly.\u201d) Experts say the three Democrats have raised enough money to run comparable campaigns. On the issues, they are more or less similar: They prioritize transportation, sustainability, the economy and education as issues. To varying degrees, they consider tax reform, veterans affairs, civil liberties and health care important, too. Among the most important issues for constituents is the increased traffic expected on Interstate 395 as federal employees move to the Mark Center in Alexandria as part of base realignment and closure moves by the Pentagon. All three have suggested ramping up public transportation in the area. The trio has also chosen the same state villain: Ken T. Cuccinelli II, Virginia\u2019s attorney general and a stalwart conservative. In his first 100 days in office, Cuccinelli sued to block the federal health-care law on constitutional grounds and advised public colleges and universities that they lacked authority to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, among other things. (Although they say they would work with Republicans on bipartisan legislation, the Democrats disagree with Cuccinelli\u2019s positions.) \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult for voters to figure out what the real difference is between these people,\u201d said Craig Brians, a political scientist and associate professor at Virginia Tech. \u201cCan you tell I\u2019m not really a fan of primaries?\u201d Although experts call this a hotly contested primary race, it\u2019s still a primary contest, and historically such events have generated low turnouts. Moreover, state redistricting has pushed the primary from June to August, when voters are often on vacation. Farnsworth estimates that 6 to 7 percent of the electorate will vote. As they canvassed in the district \u2014 which represents parts of Alexandria and Arlington and Fairfax counties \u2014 the candidates received mixed messages from potential voters. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hit hot and heavy by all the candidates,\u201d said Barbara Kerner, 66, standing outside her Alexandria house. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit overkill.\u201d Others were a bit more receptive. Ebbin found a supporter, Michele K. House, who recognized him as he knocked on the door. \u201cIt\u2019s so good that you came out in this heat,\u201d said House, 60, standing outside her side door in Arlington. \u201cWho\u2019s your opponent? Your fiercer opponent?\u201d Slightly taken aback, Ebbin began, \u201cI think any of the three of us\u201d \u2014 he paused \u2014 \u201cbut I would say Rob.\u201d \u201cI think I will vote for you,\u201d House said. \u201cLibby hasn\u2019t come over here, and I like when people go door-to-door.\u201d But Garvey visited the house of Julianne J. Cronin, 71, who would have disagreed with House. \u201cYou have had quite a life,\u201d Cronin, of Alexandria, told Garvey. \u201cI have thought very highly of you. You certainly are right there for us.\u201d \u201cCan you put up a sign?\u201d Garvey asked. Cronin nodded. \u201cOh, bless you,\u201d Garvey said. \u201cCan I hug you?\u201d The next 12 days are \u201cwhen one candidate has the chance to seal the deal with the voters,\u201d said Mark Rozell, a public policy professor at George Mason University. \u201cThis is the critical phase of the campaign.\u201d zapanav@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 16:49:04", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaldc-politicskrupicka-ebbin-garvey-vie-in-northern-virginias-30th-senate-district20110807giqangkk7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 46, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 09:56:11", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Featured Advertiser", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/a562f3c2070cfc2a221ac2afc00fb58e", "content": "<a href=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/click.phdo?s=a562f3c2070cfc2a221ac2afc00fb58e&amp;p=4\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/img.phdo?s=a562f3c2070cfc2a221ac2afc00fb58e&amp;p=4\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 16:49:04", "guid": "false", "slug": "httpfeedswashingtonpostcomrssa562f3c2070cfc2a221ac2afc00fb58e"}}, {"pk": 191, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:31:11", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "headline": "D.C.

Council members have used an independent nonprofit organization to steer millions of taxpayer dollars to favored charities, often with ties to friends or campaign donors, a Washington Post review shows.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe organization, the D.C. Children and Youth Investment Trust Corp., was created by the council to decide independently which local charities best address problems facing city youths. But The Post\u2019s review found that council members often influence those decisions, sometimes without public bids and despite a council ban on earmarks.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe trust was the go-between used by council member Harry Thomas Jr. (D-Ward 5), who recently settled a city lawsuit that had alleged he used trust grants for a luxury sport-utility vehicle and personal travel. Although there is no indication that other council members have financially benefited, some critics say the council members have used the trust in ways the council did not intend when it created the trust in 1999.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeveral private donors have become so disenchanted with the trust that they have stopped participating in it. The trust\u2019s board members are appointed by city officials, and it uses a combination of city funds and private donations, with most coming from taxpayers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCity officials directed more than $15 million in the past four years to the trust through earmarks or designated grants. The earmarks, which were standard practice until last year, specified a group without bidding. Under the ban on earmarks, designated grants specified only a purpose that required bidding, but some officials helped choose the recipients.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u25cfCouncil member Yvette Alexander (D-Ward 7) secured $387,000 from the trust for an ice arena whose board over time donated more than $13,000 to 10 city officials, including $550 to Alexander\u2019s 2007-08 campaign.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u25cfCouncil member Jim Graham (D-Ward 1) sidestepped earmarks by allocating $1.5 million in designated grants to the trust and guiding the funds to several groups in his ward.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u25cfThomas also influenced the disbursement of $1 million in grants targeted for his ward, suggesting recipients, including several that did not file required tax documents.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBesides the instances involving council members, former mayor Adrian M. Fenty\u2019s administration asked the trust to send $400,000 to an anti-gang group led by a Fenty supporter, according to interviews. A former Fenty official confirmed that account but declined to elaborate.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexander and Graham said they did not personally benefit or do anything wrong. Thomas\u2019s office declined to comment.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Post also found that although the trust requires grantees to report how they use the funds, it is unclear whether those reports are monitored. For instance, the trust could not confirm whether it had reviewed the $392,000 grant that Thomas allegedly spent on himself.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThe trust has been abused, kicked around and totally politicized,\u201d said Max Skolnik, director and founder of Kid Power Inc., which runs learning programs for under-served youths. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough trap, because we\u2019re all beholden to the trust, but none of us are happy with how it\u2019s operating.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEllen London, president of the trust, said that although she welcomes council members\u2019 input, competitive grants are the best way to make sure that money goes to organizations that can get results. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe were intended to be independent,\u201d London said. \u201cWe can, where we need to, draw that line.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFunds from the council to the trust have dwindled from $18 million in 2009 to $4.6 million this year, in part because of budget cutbacks and the end of earmarks. At the same time, the perception of political pressure on the trust has led several private donors to flee: The trust raised $500,000 this year from private donors, less than both London and City Council members had hoped. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRubie G. Coles, associate director of the Moriah Fund, a Jewish social justice foundation, stopped contributing to the trust three years ago, when its leadership changed. \u201cWe hope that board members would be appointed who have expertise in youth development and have some real skills and experience,\u201d Coles said. \u201cThat would go a long way.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDonors, nonprofit leaders and council members need to have confidence in the trust\u2019s ability to award public funds based on merit, said Winifred Carson-Smith, chairwoman of the trust\u2019s board.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThis is an unbiased process,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is totally about the children \u2014 this is not about who has influence with whom.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMillions in earmarks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe grant that Thomas allegedly diverted was one of 65 earmarks, totaling more than $13 million, that the council sent to the trust between 2008 and 2010. (Thomas declined to comment but said in a statement that he settled \u201cin the best interest of the city.\u201d)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwo of those earmarks totaled $446,000 in 2008 and 2009 and benefited the D.C. Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. Its board chairman, John L. Ray, is a lobbyist and former council member who has contributed $17,510 to nine city officials. The organization\u2019s director, Brenda Rhodes Miller, said it helps to have well-connected board members. \u201cI wish I knew how it happened so it could happen again,\u201d she said of the earmark.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Ward 7, Alexander secured $387,000 in earmarks for the Friends of Fort Dupont Ice Arena, whose board donated $550 to her campaign in 2007-08 and $13,000 to nine other officials since 2004. Alexander said campaign contributions were not a factor, noting that she keeps a tally of organizations that do good work and need funding. \u201cI think earmarks have a place, and I hope we consider bringing them back,\u201d she said. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Calvin Woodland Sr. Foundation, run by Graham\u2019s chief of staff, Calvin Woodland Jr., received a $50,000 earmark in 2009. Graham, who chairs the committee overseeing the trust, said he played no role in the earmark. Woodland acknowledged that he drew a stipend from the earmark, but the council\u2019s attorney advised him that there was no conflict of interest.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe now-defunct Hoop Dreams Scholarship Fund also received money thorough the trust, in the form of a $500,000 check presented by council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2). A foundation board member donated $6,650 to his and other officials\u2019 campaigns since 2006. Evans was not available for comment.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd council member Marion Barry (D-Ward 8) secured several 2009 earmarks for groups in his ward with ties to him. Separately, he awarded a $15,000 contract to his girlfriend. Barry was censured and stripped of his committee chairmanship for failing to disclose the personal relationship, and the council discontinued earmarks last year.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u2018Cancer in the system\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWith earmarks off the table, officials found other ways to secure money for favored projects through the trust, the Post found.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFenty city administrator Neil O. Albert said in an interview that he called then-trust Director Millicent Williams West and asked her to send $400,000 to Peaceoholics, an organization run by Fenty ally Ron Moten.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLondon, Carson-Smith and Albert confirmed the call, but Albert declined to elaborate. Neither Fenty nor West, now the District\u2019s homeland security director, returned repeated messages. Moten said his connection to Fenty did not influence the grant.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe trust denied subsequent attempts by the Fenty administration to direct money through the trust, Carson-Smith said. \u201cWhen we found out that money was not being administered in a fair and equitable manner, outside of what we considered appropriate, we asked that everything come to the board,\u201d she said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLast year, the council allocated $2.7 million in grants to the trust that did not name a recipient but could be guided toward a council member\u2019s preferred organization. It designated $1 million for youth violence prevention in Ward 5, and London said Thomas met with the trust\u2019s staff and suggested the groups he wanted funded.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOne of them was Beacon House, which received $25,000 that Deputy Director Gerry Kittner said supported tutoring and mentoring programs.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cI went to Thomas\u2019s staff and said, \u2018What\u2019s the story? Can we get some of this money?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Kittner said. \u201cWe did a work plan, but it wasn\u2019t competitive.  .\u2009.\u2009. I felt like this was money that was out there, and we were a worthy recipient.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome of the recipients had ties to Thomas, such as the Cabel Foundation, whose advisory council includes Neil Rodgers, one of Thomas\u2019s clerks; the foundation\u2019s director, Ervin C. Owens, said Rodgers didn\u2019t help him apply for the grant. Anthony \u201cCoach Tony\u201d Jones of the Falconsedge Male Task Force, an after-school sports and counseling program that received $40,000, said he and Thomas\u2019s father are old friends.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeveral of the organizations that received money from the Ward 5 grant could not be found or have failed to file required tax forms. Okera K. Stewart, director of Capitol Educational Support, which received $20,000 for its summer camp, said the organization fell behind on its paperwork but was in compliance when it received the grant. Building Better Environments, which received $45,000, had no tax filing, and the only agent listed on public records, Silas Grant Jr., said he never heard of the organization. Grant, who did not return calls for comment, is vice chairman of one of Ward 5\u2019s Advisory Neighborhood Commissions.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso last year, Graham designated a $1 million grant to the trust for a committee of three anti-gang organizations. Although the grant specified the recipients, Graham said it was not an earmark because those organizations then awarded competitive mini-grants. According to trust documents, the organizations awarded $705,000 to themselves, gave $125,000 to two groups, and the remainder was not spent.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the 2011 budget, Graham authored another designated grant: $500,000 for \u201ccommunity-based targeted gang intervention and outreach.\u201d Graham wanted the money for Green Teams \u2014 workers who pick up trash, shovel snow and remove graffiti \u2014 but the trust demurred, saying it couldn\u2019t fund an organization that didn\u2019t serve youths.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThat has not made us any friends on the city council \u2014 our budget has been heavily cut,\u201d board member Bill Treanor said. \u201cFor some council members, if you\u2019re not available as a slush fund, what\u2019s your use? And we are no longer available.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInstead, Graham said, the trust\u2019s staff consulted his office about priorities for the funds. The grant application \u2014 which London said her staff discussed with Graham\u2019s office \u2014 was narrowly tailored, such as by requiring that one of the awards go to a program at the Columbia Heights Community Center in Graham\u2019s ward.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLondon said it is not unusual to consult politicians about grants. Graham denied he helped pick the recipients and said that the mayor\u2019s office \u2014 not the council \u2014 trimmed the trust\u2019s budget.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTreanor said the trust\u2019s board is committed to protecting the trust\u2019s independence.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe do not want the council to pick the grantees,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like cancer in the system. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarnsdorfi@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 19:01:18", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaldc-politicsdc-council-members-use-nonprofit-to-secure-money-for-favored-projects20110720giqaepyn9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 192, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "headline": "2 killed in Southeast D.C. crash", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/crime-scene/post/2-killed-in-southeast-dc-crash/2011/08/12/gIQADvObAJ_blog.html?wprss=crime-scene", "content": "<p>Two women were killed in Southeast D.C.

The police response to the attack, in which five lesbians were attacked by at least two men, attracted scrutiny from members of the city\u2019s gay, lesbian and transgender community after the victims said responding officers refused to take a report.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe attacks came after a July 6 D.C. Council hearing at which Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier agreed to meet with community leaders to soothe grievances over police response to recent bias-related incidents targeting the gay, lesbian and transgender population. Lanier said Thursday that the department will conduct an internal investigation into the officers\u2019 response.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout 3 a.m. July 30, Yazzmen Morse, 21, was leaving the 7-Eleven on 14th Street NW with friends when a group of men outside the store approached them, according to interviews and police charging documents. The five women rejected their advances, said they were lesbians and continued walking toward the Metro station.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe men followed them and yelled homophobic slurs, according to Morse.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThat\u2019s when one of the guys was like: \u2018I wanna fight you. Come in this alley. I\u2019m gonna hit you,\u2019\u200a\u201d Morse recalled. The Washington Post generally does not name victims of crimes unless they give their consent in interviews.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe man swung at her several times, hit her left eye and knocked her to the ground, Morse said. Her head hit the pavement, and she saw another one of the men punching her friends in the face one after another, she said. Morse tried to defend her friends until officers arrived and broke up the fight, she said. The women suffered bruises, facial scratches, cuts and other injuries, according to charging documents. Police are still investigating the case.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNone of the seven officers at the scene agreed to take a report, according to several of the women who were interviewed this week. The attackers continued to taunt them even after the officers arrived, the women said, but the police did not intervene.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cI was crying hysterically, my eye was almost closed \u2014 swollen \u2014 and I was asking the officers, \u2018Can you please make a report? They attacked us,\u2019\u200a\u201d Morse said. \u201cThey just told us if we didn\u2019t calm down, they would lock us up for being disorderly or something.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMorse said that when it became clear that the officers did not plan to take action, she and her friends headed home. Only after Morse\u2019s mother reached out to the Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit three days later did the police file a report, Morse said. Charging documents did not mention the victims\u2019 contact with police on Saturday.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cIt was crazy. I\u2019ve heard about stuff like this happening, but it was the first time I\u2019ve actually experienced it,\u201d Morse said. \u201cIt makes me feel like all of them aren\u2019t there to do their jobs. Before I talked to [an officer from the Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit], I thought the police didn\u2019t care at all about us.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLanier, who personally apologized to the victims after learning of the incident, said the internal investigation will take about four months. If it shows that the officers wrongfully took no action, she said, they could face termination.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cOur policies are our policies, and from time to time, people don\u2019t follow policy,\u201d Lanier said, adding that she had not spoken directly with the responding officers and that she didn\u2019t think that the victims\u2019 sexual orientation was an issue in the response.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeaders of the gay, lesbian and transgender community said they feared that the incident would breed more distrust of the police among people already hesitant to turn to authorities.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThis seems to be a systematic problem,\u201d said A.J. Singletary, president of Gays and Lesbians Opposing Violence. \u201cThe leadership can say something, but unless that communication really gets down to officers in the field, it\u2019s just words.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSingletary said that in a meeting with Lanier on Friday, she said she was \u201cappalled\u201d to hear of how the officers handled the July 30 attacks and attributed their actions to \u201clazy policing.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOffenses against gay, lesbian and transgender individuals made up 60 percent of all hate crimes reported in the District between 2005 and 2010, compared with 18 percent nationwide, according to D.C. police and FBI statistics. Last year, 35 crimes were motivated by sexual orientation-related bias.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twuj@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 16:30:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaldc-man-charged-with-hate-crime-against-lesbian20110811giqapuvg9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 196, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "headline": "Featured Advertiser", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/ad6873a8bfec9b3e7b1256cc6d00b95d", "content": "<a href=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/click.phdo?s=ad6873a8bfec9b3e7b1256cc6d00b95d&amp;p=4\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/img.phdo?s=ad6873a8bfec9b3e7b1256cc6d00b95d&amp;p=4\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 16:00:00", "guid": "false", "slug": "httpfeedswashingtonpostcomrssad6873a8bfec9b3e7b1256cc6d00b95d"}}, {"pk": 54, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Train-crash victim Victor Robinson recovers after seizure may have led to fall", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/train-crash-victim-victor-robinson-recovers-after-seizure-may-have-led-to-fall/2011/08/09/gIQA4ltU7I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tVictor Robinson, a 41-year-old man with epilepsy, needed to get his watch fixed. He called his mother the afternoon of Aug. 1 and told her he had canceled his scheduled ride with Metro\u2019s door-to-door service, MetroAccess. Robinson, who has suffered seizures since he was a baby, liked the freedom of not being tethered to a reservation. After leaving his job at a nonprofit organization for the day, he planned to stop by a jewelry repair shop, catch a Red Line train at the Friendship Heights station and then head home to Petworth, said Ondina Robinson, 75. Three hours later, she received a call from Suburban Hospital, in Bethesda. Her son had been in an accident and had head and foot injuries. Could she come to the hospital soon? Robinson had become the eighth passenger this year struck by a Metro train, the transit authority said. That\u2019s more than the seven who were struck in all of last year, according to Metro\u2019s records. Twelve riders were hit by trains in 2009, including a single accident in which a blind Rockville man tumbled from the platform at Gallery Place. \u201cBy all indications, this appears to be an unfortunate accident,\u201d Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said. Officially, the Robinson case was still under investigation, he said. Robinson\u2019s family thinks he might have had a severe seizure while standing on the platform at Friendship Heights and then fell onto the tracks. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d said his father, Sherman Robinson. \u201cI was fearful for the present and the future. My fear was, \u2018Will he recover, and what will become of his quality of life?\u2019\u200a\u201d A video from the station shows that \u201cwhile on the track,\u201d Robinson was in \u201cdistress and made several attempts to recover from the fall but was unsuccessful,\u201d Stessel said. The train operator told Metro investigators that she \u201cactivated the mushroom,\u201d a button on the console in the operator\u2019s cab that applies the emergency brake, but the train could not stop in time, he said. Robinson was conscious when first responders arrived, but his right foot had been severed, and he was suffering bleeding in the brain, according to a doctors\u2019 report. He was found with two items he often wears: a silver \u201cSuperman\u201d ring and his medical ID bracelet. Robinson underwent surgery to amputate part of his right leg, his family said. Doctors also repaired his broken right wrist. On Wednesday, he was listed in critical but stable condition, his family said. His family has stayed by his bedside for up to six hours a day. They call his name, pray with him and tell jokes in hopes he\u2019ll hear them in the depths of his medically induced coma. \u201cWe ask him, \u2018Victor, do you want a Big Mac?\u2019\u200a\u201d said his twin sister, Victoria Dancy of Upper Marlboro. Last Wednesday, he responded to commands from doctors to move his fingers and open his eyes. The next day, he opened his eyes slightly and looked toward his mother as she called his name. \u201cThat\u2019s always encouraging for us,\u201d Dancy said. \u201cIt\u2019s an indication that he\u2019s still here with us.\u201d Her own superhero Robinson, an avid collector of toy cars, key chains, puzzles, T-shirts, baseball hats and trains, has regularly participated in the Special Olympics since middle school, his family said. He graduated from Roosevelt High School in the District and works for Quality Trust for Individuals With Disabilities as an advocacy outreach specialist. He met Thelma Greene, his fiancee, through a jobs training program, and the two have talked about possibly getting married next Valentine\u2019s Day, she said. Greene, who has cerebral palsy and lives in Shaw, hasn\u2019t visited the hospital. She said she thinks it would be too hard to see him in ICU with tubes and bandages. She\u2019s relied on reports from his family. She said she plans to make a tape for his family to play to remind him of their long-running joke. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him Lois Lane loves him, and she wants Superman to hurry up and get better,\u201d said Greene, 51. \u201cCome back so he can hurry up and rescue her.\u201d Born about seven minutes after his twin, Robinson first started having seizures when he was 8 months old, his mother said. Even with medication, his seizures are unpredictable, she said. He sometimes has them in the morning as he is getting ready for work, his mother said. \u201cI\u2019d tell him, \u2018Victor, go lie down,\u2019\u200a\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018No, no. I have to go. I have to get to work.\u2019\u200a\u201d Dancy said Robinson\u2019s attitude about his conditionhas always been, \u201c\u200a\u2018Yeah, I have epilepsy, but I don\u2019t let it stop me from doing what I need to do and want to do.\u2019\u200a\u201d In recent months, Robinson had switched from taking MetroAccess daily to get to his job to using buses and trains some days because, in part, he liked the independence, his family said. He also had become concerned that recent increases in MetroAccess fares had pushed the cost of his daily rides to work to as much as $14. It costs Metro about $40 to provide a MetroAccess ride through a contractor. The transit agency charges MetroAccess riders a maximum of $7 each way. \u201cHe didn\u2019t believe the cost should go up for himself and others like him given that many disabled people are on a fixed income, and riding MetroAccess is quite a costly trip,\u201d Dancy said. His family said they expect Robinson to view the prosthetic leg doctors say he needs as \u201cno big deal.\u201d A family\u2019s perseverance Robinson\u2019s relatives said their strong faith in God has helped sustain them \u2014 just as it did in 1994, when his eldest sister died instantly in a car accident. \u201cYou go to the hospital to see how he\u2019s doing, to encourage him by whatever means we can,\u201d his father said. \u201cJust our presence at the hospital is so connecting. We\u2019re together.\u201d Robinson\u2019s mother said he was looking forward to going on a Potomac River dinner cruise last Sunday to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the nonprofit group where he worked. Robinson had made the reservation just hours before the accident. On Sunday, his parents said, a MetroAccess vehicle showed up \u2014 promptly at 4:30 p.m. hedgpethd@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 18:45:30", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaltrain-crash-victim-victor-robinson-recovers-after-seizure-may-have-led-to-fall20110809giqa4ltu7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 56, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Wal-Mart donation to pay for job training in D.C.", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/wal-mart-donation-to-pay-for-job-training-in-dc/2011/08/10/gIQAlSkg7I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tWal-Mart\u2019s charitable foundation will make a $3\u00a0million donation to finance job readiness and workforce training programs in the District, part of an effort to address above-average unemployment and improve the retailer\u2019s image as it angles to open its first D.C. stores. Over a three-year period, the money will pay for training at the city\u2019s new Community College of D.C., part of the University of the District of Columbia, and a literacy grant program to be administered by the Community Foundation for the National Capital Region. D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) is expected to announce the partnership in a Thursday press conference. The money will pay for workforce development and job preparation for 2,000 city residents at a time when the District\u2019s unemployment rate is on the rise, up 0.6 percent to 10.4 percent in June. Lisa Mallory, director of the D.C. Department of Employment Services, said the funding is sorely needed to help prepare residents to work, \u201cnot just for Wal-Mart but for every retail employer.\u201d The donation will also further a campaign by the chain to use charitable dollars to continue to burnish its image. In November, Wal-Mart announced plans to open its first four stores in the District and hire 1,200 people by 2012. That timeline appears out of reach, as Wal-Mart has not signed leases for any of the stores, but the plans remain intact despite public requests for the company to make concessions to workers, a \u201cflash mob\u201d protest at the chain\u2019s Laurel store and multiple rallies at the chain\u2019s Washington offices. In the meantime, Wal-Mart and its foundation have poured millions of dollars into programs and charities that are close to the hearts of Gray and D.C. residents, including $2.4\u00a0million in contributions for its fiscal year ending Jan. 31 to groups such as the Boys & Girls Clubs, the Capital Area Food Bank and the Greater Washington Urban League. Wal-Mart announced $665,000 in grants for the mayor\u2019s Summer Youth Employment Program and school nutrition in June, and another $100,000 grant to help reduce pollution in the Anacostia River last week. Gray helped create the new community college, which will use the Wal-Mart money to provide customer service training and a \u201cretail academy\u201d to prepare residents for entry-level retail jobs. In an interview, Michelle D. Gilliard, a senior director at the Wal-Mart Foundation, said that workforce development was one of the foundation\u2019s four target giving areas. She said the company was committed to hiring city residents. \u201cAll companies need to develop professional, well-prepared customer service employees, and we see this as a part of that,\u201d she said. Mallory stressed that the training partnership with Wal-Mart would benefit city residents regardless of how many stores the company opened. \u201cThe Wal-Mart Foundation has stepped up to do this, but we\u2019re willing to work with anybody,\u201d she said. oconnellj@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 09:01:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocalwal-mart-donation-to-pay-for-job-training-in-dc20110810giqalskg7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 197, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "headline": "Robyn Gardner case: Aruban authorities say Giordano no longer cooperating; FBI gets involved", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/crime-scene/post/aruban-authorities-say-giordano-no-longer-cooperating/2011/08/11/gIQAF0Lp9I_blog.html?wprss=crime-scene", "content": "<p></p>\n<p>The Montgomery County man held in Aruba as part of a high-profile missing-persons case is no longer cooperating, authorities said Thursday night as they appealed to the public for help.</p>\n<p>FBI officials also said that they are providing assistance to Aruban authorities and interviewing people in the United States, but declined to give details or say who was being interviewed.</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/crime-scene/post/aruban-authorities-say-giordano-no-longer-cooperating/2011/08/11/gIQAF0Lp9I_blog.html?wprss=crime-scene\">Read full article  &gt;&gt;</a><br clear=\"both\" style=\"clear: both;\" />\n<br clear=\"both\" style=\"clear: both;\" />\n<a href=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/click.phdo?s=349c51ae90cd0f6cd745be72de285e78&amp;p=1\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/img.phdo?s=349c51ae90cd0f6cd745be72de285e78&amp;p=1\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a>\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"http://segment-pixel.invitemedia.com/pixel?code=News&amp;partnerID=167&amp;key=segment\" style=\"display: none;\" width=\"0\" /><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8bUhLiluj0fAw.gif?labels=pub.30117.rss.News.40157,cat.News.rss\" style=\"display: none;\" width=\"0\" /><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"http://amch.questionmarket.com/adsc/d887846/17/909940/adscout.php\" style=\"display: none;\" width=\"0\" />", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 19:19:54", "guid": "false", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomblogscrime-scenepostaruban-authorities-say-giordano-no-longer-cooperating20110811giqaf0lp9i_bloghtmlwprsscrime-scene"}}, {"pk": 195, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:31:13", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "headline": "Arlington bank robber has been busy", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/arlington-bank-robber-has-been-busy/2011/08/11/gIQAXL5c9I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tAuthorities say one man is responsible for at least half of the bank robberies in Arlington County this year, and the FBI and police hope to figure out who he is before he strikes again. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe has done as many as five robberies since June, authorities say. There have been eight bank robberies in the county this year, compared with three in 2010. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAuthorities know what the man looks like from surveillance videos \u2013 white, in his 50s, about six feet tall and with a thin build \u2014 and they said he appears to coolly execute the crimes. They don\u2019t know much else about him, however.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cIf we had enough information to put out who he was, we would,\u201d said Detective Crystal Nosal, an Arlington police spokeswoman. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe man doesn\u2019t cover his face during the robberies, but he wears a cap and glasses. He walks casually into the bank branches he robs, authorities said, and once wore a neon green shirt. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAuthorities said that the robber is responsible for four bank robberies from June 6 to Aug. 4 and that he might have committed another Tuesday. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe has targeted bank \u00adbranches on Washington Boulevard and Lee Highway, authorities said, and he has twice robbed a BB&T branch in the 5500 block of Lee Highway \u2014 once  June 16 and again Aug. 4. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTuesday\u2019s robbery was at a United Bank in the 5300 block of Lee Highway.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe robberies have not all been done in the same way. In two cases, the robber presented a teller with a note demanding money, authorities said. In the other two, he announced a stickup. He has not shown a weapon, authorities said. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cSometimes there\u2019s a note. Sometimes he implies he has a weapon. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Nosal said. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough there were only three bank robberies in Arlington last year, the county has averaged about eight a year in recent years. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAcross Northern Virginia \u2014 including Arlington, Fairfax, Prince William and Loudoun counties \u2014 the number of bank robberies dropped by half from fiscal 2006 to 2010, according to the FBI, whose fiscal year ends Sept. 30. In the FBI\u2019s fiscal 2006, there were 86, compared with 43 in fiscal 2010. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the District, there were 36 bank robberies in fiscal 2010, compared with 45 in 2006,  according to FBI data. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAcross the country, bank robberies are also decreasing. There were 5,546 in the 2010 calendar year, down from 6,700 in 2008, data show.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Still, most banks have surveillance cameras in case there is a robbery. Bank tellers are told to give up the cash in their drawers if confronted by a robber, but sometimes a teller will put a dye pack in a bag of money. The pack explodes after the robber leaves the bank and marks the stolen cash with the dye.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBB&T officials declined to discuss security measures. The robber has hit BB&T branches three times, authorities said.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cAt BB&T, we are committed to providing a safe and secure environment in which our clients can conduct their banking business,\u201d BB&T spokesman David White said. \u201cWe cannot comment on the security measures we employ as to do so would compromise the safety and the security of our clients and employees.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkleinallison@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 16:00:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocalarlington-bank-robber-has-been-busy20110811giqaxl5c9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 198, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:31:14", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "headline": "Prince William day-care provider charged with neglect", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/prince-william-day-care-provider-charged-with-neglect/2011/08/11/gIQA1zRc9I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tA Prince William County day-care provider was accused of child neglect after a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old in her care wandered out of her house and into the neighborhood, police said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaleighia G.

Shockey was unaware that the two girls had left, police said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolice said the children were outside for about an hour and, according to a map, had wandered about 500 feet from Shockey\u2019s home.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe girls were not harmed and were returned to family members, police said. Prince William Child Protective Services was notified about the case.

Gittens, the first African American agent in the Secret Service and the former head of the agency\u2019s Washington field office, died July\u00a027 at an assisted living center in Mitchellville after a heart attack. He was 82. An Army veteran, Mr. Gittens joined the Secret Service in 1956 and was soon posted to its New York field office, where he was part of an elite \u201cspecial detail\u201d that targeted counterfeiters and other criminals across the country.  Mr. Gittens would go on to protect presidents and became a well-respected supervisor.  \u201cHe was a great agent,\u201d said Mark Sullivan, director of the Secret Service. \u201cWhen you talk to people who worked with him, the one thing I hear is that he was just a regular guy. .\u2009.\u2009. A lot of agents, black and white, have benefited from the things he has done. He led by example, and he set the standards for all of us to follow.\u201d Charles LeRoy Gittens was born Aug. 31, 1928, in Cambridge, Mass. He left high school to join the Army, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant and was posted in Japan during the Korean War. He obtained a GED while in the military and, after his discharge, received a bachelor\u2019s degree from what is now North Carolina Central University.  In the 1950s, while teaching at a high school in North Carolina, Mr. Gittens was encouraged by friends to apply for a job in federal law enforcement. After taking a civil service test, he was recruited by the Secret Service.  However, he almost never became an agent because he failed an oral entrance exam, according to a 1974 story in Ebony magazine.  \u201cCan you imagine such a thing?\u201d Mr. Gittens told Ebony. \u201cThe guy in charge had scribbled things down like, \u2018speaks incoherently\u2019 or \u2018can\u2019t be understood.\u2019 Now a Boston accent is a pretty strange thing in Atlanta, Georgia \u2014 that much I can assure you. But that was really too much.\u201d Mr. Gittens implied that the real reason may have been racism. He was then given another test and passed. Though Mr. Gittens told friends he never felt discrimination from other agents or supervisors, he still faced it on the job. While guarding President Lyndon B. Johnson on a trip to Dallas, he and other agents entered a restaurant, and its manager initially refused to serve him because he was black, according to the Ebony story. \u201cThe other guys were a lot angrier than I was,\u201d Mr. Gittens told the magazine. \u201cBut the manager came out and apologized profusely. And we eventually got served.\u201d Mr. Gittens protected other presidents and stood just a few steps from John F. Kennedy at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden in 1962 when Marilyn Monroe serenaded him with a sultry version of \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d  In 1971, Mr. Gittens was appointed special agent in charge of the Washington field office, a prestigious posting in which he supervised about 120 agents. Mr. Gittens \u2014 a founding member of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives \u2014 also was tasked in the 1970s by the Secret Service with helping to boost the recruitment of minority and female agents. The Service now has 3,525 agents, of whom 299 are black.  After retiring in 1979, he joined the Justice Department\u2019s Nazi-hunting Office of Special Investigations and became deputy director of the criminal division. His first marriage, of 28 years, to Ruth Hamme ended in divorce. His 10-year marriage to Maureen Petersen also ended in divorce. Survivors include a daughter from his first marriage, Sharon Quick of Washington, and two stepdaughters. .  Mr. Gittens settled in the Washington area in 1971 and moved last year from Fort Washington to Collington Episcopal Life Care Community in Mitchellville. Although regarded as a Secret Service trailblazer, Mr. Gittens earned respect from agents by hitting the streets. In the mid-1970s, he was monitoring a counterfeiting bust when the suspect suddenly bolted.

Switching gears in ninth grade to a more complicated class schedule and multiple after-school activities requires a fresh approach. This is the teachable moment, Kelley says, to pass on some of the most valuable of life skills: organization and time management. For many teens, high school has become a sprint to get good grades and extracurricular  Brownie points and then stay calm through the college application whirlwind. They need help accomplishing multiple goals.  Kelley, whose business is called Clearing House, says there are rewards for investing the hours and a bit of money into strategizing with your teen. The effort can reap a savings of time, improve relations between a parent and a teen, create independence and decrease pressure. She encourages parents to be partners in setting up systems and then being supportive. \u201cSay, \u2018Let\u2019s see what works for you,\u2019 \u201d Kelley explains. \u201cAsk, \u2018What are your goals?\u2019 \u201d  Kelley, the youngest of nine children, says she was always detail-oriented. Her parents set a daily agenda and stuck to a chore list. \u201cWe had to be responsible. My parents were master delegators,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were trained to do a job and implement it without a lot of follow-up.\u201d  Today, she counsels others to be empowered, using organizing tricks that help with paper management and reinforce time-management skills. She tells her own boys,    \u201cOrganize things so when you need them, you will find them. Put stuff away. You\u2019ll have more time for fun things.\u201d  Tips from a professional organizer Parents can help high-schoolers reboot study routines at the start of the academic year. Here is a list of organizing strategies from Jackie Kelley. \u25a0Clear backlog: Set aside a few hours before school begins to de-clutter study spaces, purge old school papers and inventory school supplies.  \u25a0Identify student study preferences: Does the student use a desk, bed, dining table, kitchen counter or floor for studying? Make sure the area of choice is cleared off and comfortable. \u25a0Evaluate study zone: See if the desk or work table, chair, lighting, bookshelf and filing system need updating.   \u25a0Set up systems for papers and calendar: Create simple, easy-to-use files by subject to manage incoming papers as well as archives. Support scheduled tasks and activities by acquiring a wall calendar and weekly planner to keep track of dates. \u25a0Develop maintenance routine: Talk to your teen about keeping study materials organized during the school year. Many students find it worthwhile to spend a few minutes at the end of each day straightening up study spaces, binders and backpacks. Others may block off a weekly de-cluttering session on their calendars.  Back to school prep Ready to get organized?

But for earlier generations, there was one dominant option: a metal lunchbox, usually decorated with characters from comic strips, movies or television. Picking out the perfect design for the school year was one of the rites of August, right along with getting new shoes and a haircut. Today, those metal lunchboxes form a whole category of collectibles, with prices up to thousands of dollars. There\u2019s also a brisk trade in reproduction boxes and in plain metal ones that you can decorate on your own. The earliest metal lunchboxes, from the late 1800s, were utilitarian containers for factory and mine workers, or repurposed tins that once held tobacco or other products. Walt Disney came out with a Mickey Mouse lunchbox in the 1930s but only for a couple of years. Metal lunchboxes didn\u2019t take off as a school-kid staple until the 1950s, after Aladdin Industries began making boxes that featured Hopalong Cassidy, a cowboy in movies and the first TV westerns, according to a buying guide published on eBay. Today, eBay serves as the premier marketplace for vintage lunchboxes, but you can also find them at garage and estate sales and at stores that specialize in collectibles from the 1950s on. The Lunchbox Museum in Columbus, Ga., which claims to have the largest collection in the world, and Clarke\u2019s Collectibles and Lunchbox Museum in Nice, Calif., both sell boxes that duplicate what\u2019s in their permanent collections. \u201cThese lunchboxes bring back memories,\u201d says Allen Woodall, owner of the Georgia museum and co-author of \u201cThe Illustrated Encyclopedia of Metal Lunch Boxes\u201d (Schiffer, $29.95). It\u2019s one of at least five books on this niche, an indication of how popular the lunchboxes have become. \u201cThey\u2019re like time capsules,\u201d Woodall says. \u201cPeople see them and might remember the one they carried in school, or they see a character they remember and then a big smile comes on their face.\u201d Because kids gravitate toward designs featuring the most popular entertainment figures, vintage lunchboxes track popular culture through the decades. \u201cHopalong Cassidy\u201d (a TV show from 1952-54) gradually yielded to \u201cWagon Train\u201d (1957-65) and then \u201cBonanza\u201d (1959-73). There were Barbie lunchboxes for girls and G.I. Joe lunchboxes for boys, boxes with photographs of real astronauts and characters from \u201cLost in Space\u201d (1965-68). \u201cThey\u2019re a very pop culture kind of thing, with many different genres: Saturday morning cartoons, Marvel comics,\u201d says Jake Lefebure, a longtime collector who runs the Design Army graphics design firm in the District. \u201cI have some that are battle kits. One is all about making metrics cool: \u2018The Exciting World of Metrics.\u2019 I\u2019m sure kids got beat up for taking that to school.\u201d  Most lunchboxes were rectangular, but there were also dome-top boxes with storage space for a Thermos bottle in the lid. A dome-top box painted to look like a yellow school bus with Walt Disney cartoon characters peeking out of the windows was the most popular lunchbox ever, according to the eBay guide, though the specific characters changed over the years. Metal lunchboxes went out of fashion and were even banned by some school districts in the 1980s, after a group of mothers in Florida campaigned to have them outlawed as weapons. Woodall laughs at that now. \u201cReally, kids were banging them up to make sure they got new ones,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they were banned in Florida, and then it went from state to state. The decline was so big that the manufacturers stopped making them.\u201d Today, metal lunchboxes are again being made, thanks to the popularity \u2014 and prices \u2014 of the vintage models. Some schools are happy to see kids using them, vintage or new, because they cut waste. The stiff sides protect food well \u2014 no more squished peanut butter sandwiches. And the containers are reusable indefinitely. Rust is the only worry, but it\u2019s easy to prevent that simply by drying the lunchbox each time you wipe or wash it out. Vintage or reproduction lunchboxes also make great containers for all sorts of other things, from first aid kits to postcard collections. For serious collectors who care about value, the big money is in designs that dovetail with themes that drive collectors to seek out items other than just lunchboxes. Collectors love Beatles memorabilia, so Beatles lunchboxes often go for $600 or more. Other popular themes are space exploration, westerns, Disney and \u201canything to do with fire,\u201d Woodall says. But if you just want a colorful box with fun characters or words that somehow catch your fancy, you can get something good for $20 to $35. As with any collectible, quality matters. Rust, scratches and dents reduce the price. But authenticity also matters, which is why Woodall says he knows of no one who restores beat-up lunchboxes. When the Smithsonian Museum of American History came calling and wanted to buy lunchboxes from him (he also donated many), curators sought out boxes that showed wear and were scribbled with kids\u2019 names. \u201cThey wanted them as they were used, not new,\u201d Woodall says.  Huber is a special correspondent who writes the How To column, which will return next week.  MORE: Share your photos: Have a treasured (or perhaps embarassing) childhood lunchbox?

It lined my grandmother\u2019s cabinets in quart jars, along with preserved figs and hot pepper vinegar, and whenever I heard talk of pickles, that\u2019s what came to mind. Grace Lichaa\u2019s childhood pickles were different. Lichaa, whose parents immigrated to the United States from Egypt in the late \u201960s, recalls a Gaithersburg household in which her mother was always pickling some vegetable or another. Jars of torshi \u2014 vinegar-packed cauliflower, celery and carrot with a look of Italian giardiniera \u2014 weren\u2019t just lovely, but tempting. \u201cI can remember reaching my whole arm into the jar \u2014 it sounds gross \u2014 and just eating it straight out of my hand,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was that good.\u201d Because Lichaa, 33, works weekend farmers markets for Pennsylvania\u2019s New Morning Farm, she runs into harvest excess that doesn\u2019t always have obvious applications. Recently, with several bunches of beets on her hands and an equal number of questions, she answered with pickled beets, using an Egyptian recipe from her mother. They are piquant, bright with acidity but earthy with cumin, the sort you might pile next to a plate of long-cooked green beans or simply eat from the jar with a fork. A week or so later she put together a batch of her mom\u2019s eggplant pickles, made with fairy-tale eggplants the size of fingerling potatoes that are halved and rubbed liberally with cilantro and garlic. Drinking the pungent olive oil-vinegar brine is worth any social cost. It makes sense that some of the most imaginative recipes for putting food up (or putting it by, depending on where you\u2019re from) come from farmers and the staff members helping to sell their produce. After all, they have abundance close at hand. Often they\u2019re putting up a lot of food, and they\u2019re not always sticking to the recipes they grew up with. Now that canning isn\u2019t much of a contemporary novelty anymore, a younger, globally minded generation is turning to spices and seasonings more common in kitchens half a world away. Such a modern approach seems particularly well suited to pickling, which I think of as canning\u2019s kinky cousin, not only preserving food but transforming it into something almost provocative, more intensely flavored and more curiously textured than it was to begin with. Pickles ask for your attention. When they\u2019re seasoned in ways unexpected or culturally unconventional, they come right out and grab it. Casey Gustowarow, 29, farm manager at Potomac Vegetable Farms West in Purcellville and one of the creators of the White House Organic Farm Project, makes a Cambodian-style refrigerated pickle with frilly-leaved Napa cabbage that carries the funky, complex appeal of kimchi. Lemon grass, turmeric, ginger and a hot-sour-salty-sweet brine remind him of his stint as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Philippines; to anyone else, it\u2019s an arresting profile for a usually demure vegetable. It was Lichaa who turned me on to the idea that mustard greens make a keen showing as pickles. Her method is meant to replicate the sour mustard greens served at the Burmese restaurant Mandalay in Silver Spring, but the homespun version, made with New Morning\u2019s Asian mustard greens (the red ones bleed a hibiscus pink), is more nuanced, with a mellowed bite and nutty undertones. At Zach Lester and Georgia O\u2019Neal\u2019s Tree and Leaf Farm in Unionville, Va., pickling is farm manager Katherine Stewart\u2019s answer to overabundance and threats of lost harvests. Working on a farm convinced her that anything could be pickled (or fermented; she has also made a habit of kimchi, kombucha and grain-fermented sodas), and should be. \u201cI started experimenting with anything we had in excess,\u201d said Stewart, 33. \u201cAt one point we had all of these adorable pearl onions that were going to go to waste, and you just can\u2019t throw those away.\u201d Summers in Virginia, eggplant starts in July and carries on until October; at the Dupont Circle FreshFarm Market, Tree and Leaf\u2019s tables carry cascades of heirloom varieties, fat lavender Sicilian ones and slender Asian ones among them. On the farm, the production can seem endless. Stewart\u2019s response is eggplant pickles, an Italian take bathed in vinegar and packed in olive oil. They\u2019re nearly decadent, creamy-textured and slightly sweet, with the faintest fire of red chili. Adding whole coriander seeds suggests Tunisia, and sometimes she goes that route instead. Usually she makes enough for two seasons beyond the harvest, which prompts a culinary query, Stewart says: \u201cHow will I actually eat this once I pickle it?\u201d She finds a place for it on pizza, in pasta or stir-fries, with cheese and crackers. In Italy, where the dish is called melanzane sott\u2019olio, it might just be eaten from a plate, without fuss of companionship. After all, pickles are just another way to eat vegetables, which makes particular sense in cold-weather months when in-season pickings are slimmer and when what\u2019s available \u2014 root vegetables and leafy greens, for the most part \u2014 could make good use of lively accompaniment. The trick is keeping them around that long.

Theater staffers say they\u2019ve sold 35,000 tickets for the reprise run, with most performances selling at \u201cnear capacity.\u201d Though they don\u2019t release financial figures for individual shows, a spokesperson for the company says the revival will probably outpace the original fall production and become the best-selling show in Arena\u2019s history. And Woolly Mammoth\u2019s remount of its 2010 hit \u201cClybourne Park\u201d is selling out and helping the company finish in the black, even after losing a major grant. For the much smaller Constellation Theatre Company, though, the idea of reprising a popular show has been a grand experiment, but it may be more for the glory than for the bucks. A bit of net profit wasn\u2019t the only reason that Constellation\u2019s Allison Arkell Stockman decided to remount the popular 2010 show \u201cThe Ramayana,\u201d but the artistic director was hoping for it. The remount, however, has proved to be more of a learning experience than a purse-filler for the four-year-old troupe. Stockman\u2019s colorful staging of the ancient Indian epic, which continues at Source through Aug. 21, involved 21/2 weeks of rehearsal to incorporate six new actors, or about half the cast; alterations to the elaborate costumes for the newbies; and rental fees for the intimate Source space, which seats a maximum of 120. Stockman says the three-week run won\u2019t be long enough to make back the $65,000 cost of the remount. Her small company operates on an annual budget of $350,000, about 70 percent of it from donations and 30 percent from ticket sales. Stockman estimates that Constellation will take a loss of $10,000 to $15,000 on its \u201cRamayana\u201d revival, even though tickets were selling at more than 60 percent of capacity before previews began Aug. 4. But she says there\u2019s a positive side to bringing back a show that won strong reviews and a Helen Hayes Award for percussionist-composer Tom Teasley\u2019s sound design. \u201cOn just ticket sales, we will lose money, but I think on audience growth and the support of people that are newly invested or reinvested [in Constellation] because of the show .\u2009.\u2009. it will be a positive financial thing for us,\u201d Stockman said. Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company\u2019s high-profile remount of \u201cClybourne Park\u201d is sold out through its Aug. 14 closing. Jeffrey Herrmann, Woolly\u2019s managing director, said in an e-mail that the revival \u201chas officially become the highest grossing show in the theatre\u2019s history.\u201d The first run of the show, in spring 2010, was previously Woolly\u2019s highest-selling show, he said. The company \u201cbudgeted very conservatively\u201d for the remount and increased performances to eight per week in response to demand, Herrmann said. Despite the recent loss of a government grant worth about $225,000 \u2014 about 5 percent of Woolly\u2019s $4.2\u00a0million budget \u2014 he expects Woolly to finish its 2011 fiscal year in the black because of \u201cClybourne Park\u201d and increased fundraising efforts. A new Aunt Eller Terry Burrell has just stepped into a big pair of high-button shoes at Arena Stage. The Atlanta-based singer-actress has replaced E. Faye Butler as Aunt Eller, the frontier wise-woman in Arena\u2019s remount of \u201cOklahoma!\u201d Butler had to start work on her lead role in the play \u201cTrouble in Mind,\u201d set to run at Arena from Sept. 9 through Oct. 23. Jumping into some fast-track rehearsals last week felt \u201clike being shot out of a cannon,\u201d Burrell said. She watched a performance with Butler in the role, and said: \u201cThe thing that really struck me was the pacing of the show. It moves very fast .\u2009.\u2009. and yet Aunt Eller, of all the characters in the show, pretty much is the only one that has the freedom to set her own pace.\u201d Burrell said Butler told her that Aunt Eller is really \u201cthe only adult on the stage.\u201d Butler says she\u2019s proud to have played Aunt Eller in Artistic Director Molly Smith\u2019s ethnically diverse take on the musical. \u201cI know that an African American woman had never really played Aunt Eller on a professional stage. And so what an honor it was to be able to do a groundbreaking role like Aunt Eller, and then to be African American and do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of sad to be leaving it, on one hand, because it\u2019s in my body, and I\u2019ve developed a whole new group of family,\u201d Butler says of her bond with the cast. \u201cWe went through a new journey that no one had ever done before on the American stage with this new conception of \u2018Oklahoma!\u2019 But now, like any baby, I just have to put it to sleep for a second and [do] something else.\u201d Aunt Eller also has some of the script\u2019s funniest lines, and Butler, with her pinpoint comic timing, took full advantage of them. Burrell said she told Butler: \u201cAll the good stuff, I\u2019m stealing. .\u2009.\u2009. Some color that she has in there that seems really perfect for the character, there\u2019s really no need to change it .\u2009.\u2009. little vocal inflections that she has some places, that I\u2019d like to use. I have her official permission to steal whatever I can use.\u201d After a pause, she added, \u201cAt least I asked.\u201d Mark your calendars \u25cfAfter its \u201cRamayana\u201d remount, Constellation Theatre Company\u2019s 2011-12 season will feature \u201cArms and the Man\u201d (Oct. 20-Nov. 20) by George Bernard Shaw, staged by Stockman; \u201cBlood Wedding\u201d (Feb. 2-March 4) by Federico Garcia Lorca, directed by Shirley Serotsky; and \u201cThe Love of the Nightingale\u201d (May 3-June 2) by Timberlake Wertenbaker, directed by Stockman.www.constellationtheatre.org. \u25cfAmerican Century Theater in Arlington, which specializes in rarely performed works from the American theatrical canon, will open its 2011-12 season with \u201cThe Country Girl\u201d (Sept. 9-Oct. 8) by Clifford Odets, directed by Steven Scott Mazzola.

He\u2019s a shell of a shell, a quaking, sobbing wreck. Racked ever more violently by the realization that the professor for whom he has slaved is an intellectual sham and the woman he loves is for\u00adever out of reach, this tortured Vanya comes across as the active ingredient in utter despair. \u201cFor 25 years, he\u2019s added nothing to nothing!\u201d he wails bitterly about his adversary, as if suddenly understanding that his life adds up to the same sum. Roxburgh\u2019s desolation is so authentically articulated that you may sense you\u2019re feeling the totality of Vanya\u2019s pain for the first time. It\u2019s a startling portrayal, emblematic of the seismic emotions of the intoxicating, go-for-broke \u201cUncle Vanya\u201d that comes from Down Under courtesy of Cate Blanchett and her Sydney Theatre Company. All your suppositions about Chekhov\u2019s soulful gentility fly out the doors of the Kennedy Center\u2019s Eisenhower Theater with this tornadic rendering of a country estate consuming itself in the misery of missed opportunities. Who says torpor isn\u2019t a dynamic noun? In director Tamas Ascher\u2019s inspired conception, even the bugs we hear whirring around the inhabitants\u2019 faces are calculated to drive up the harassment index, the sense that the household is being driven to distraction by forces minuscule and monumental. Ascher, a Hungarian, moves the tragicomedy up in time, from Chekhov\u2019s czarist Russia, circa 1899, to the Soviet era, say around 1955. In the context of a spreading totalitarian malaise, the transposition \u2014 aided immensely by Andrew Upton\u2019s punchy translation \u2014 works terrifically. Our familiarity with reflections on the oppressiveness of the Soviet era turns this stifling landscape into apt metaphor. So when the magnetic doctor, Astrov, played to beguiling, vodka-soaked perfection by Hugo Weaving, talks of a brighter future for generations yet unborn, we intuit even more profoundly than usual that it\u2019s a future he doesn\u2019t believe in. The period updating is packaged grandly by set designer Zsolt Khell: The manse of ghastly professorial prig Serebryakov (John Bell) and his younger second wife Yelena (Blanchett) is a shabby husk, with dirty walls and spartan furniture \u2014 the kind of place that looks as if it might long ago have been ransacked and stripped bare by emboldened members of the proletariat. It\u2019s a place in which grudges naturally marinate. Vanya, the brother of Serebryakov\u2019s late first wife, resentfully runs the estate with the professor\u2019s daughter Sonya (Hayley McElhinney) while the older man lives the life of an esteemed academic, accompanied by the beautiful Yelena, whom Vanya not-so-secretly adores. The Sydney company, run jointly by Blanchett and Upton, came to town two years ago with an astonishing version of \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire,\u201d which was anchored by the actress. In its way, this emotionally in-touch \u201cUncle Vanya,\u201d buoyed by its entire cast, is just as extraordinary.  Chekhov\u2019s gift for illuminating the essence of each of his characters\u2019 poignant, comic struggles is magnified in Ascher\u2019s treatment. The scenes crackle with sponta\u00adneity, and as a result, you often find yourself laughing at bits of behavior because you recognize them as both theatrically inventive and true. Are there not occasions in everyday life when a room rears up in awkward silence? This \u201cVanya\u201d is filled with stunned moments emptied of conversation: Words frequently fail these unhappy people, which is perhaps why the scenes fueled by drink work particularly well here. Vodka really is the magic elixir of Russian ennui. No time is this more delightfully apparent than in a surprising reconciliation scene between Blanchett\u2019s Yelena and McElhinney\u2019s Sonya. Their fractious standoff, forged out of plain-Jane Son\u00adya\u2019s unrequited feelings for Astrov and her jealousy of Yelena, melts away after a few naughty shots, and soon they\u2019re on the floor, mischievously, hilariously. McElhinney manages to convey both the earthiness of Sonya \u2014 she seems completely the toughened young woman of the soil \u2014 and her readiness to yield to childish fancies. Her default posture in the house is perching on a little girl\u2019s chair, in the embrace of the old nanny, Marina (a fine Jacki Weaver). Blanchett\u2019s high-strung, drop-dead-gorgeous Yelena is the yin to McElhinney\u2019s yang; costume designer Gyorgi Szakacs pours her into form-fitting red dresses and striking cream ensembles, as if all the proceeds from the working estate went into her closets. Sexually self-conscious, romantically malnourished and understandably restless, Blanchett\u2019s captivating Yelena walks the Earth as a creature hypersensitive to touch. Beseeched by the snarling, elderly Serebryakov for a crumb of affection, this Yelena grudgingly complies, and the way in which Blanchett seems to prepare herself for this ordeal recalls the manner in which contestants steeled themselves to swallow caterpillars on \u201cFear Factor.\u201d The passionate attraction of Yelena to Astrov is just as palpable, and when at last she lets down her guard, the force unleashed is \u2014 like so much that occurs in this tortured, rural powder keg \u2014 concussive. The electrical charge is held all the way through to the play\u2019s waning moments, when Son\u00adya tries, for what may be the 1,000th time, to give Vanya a rationale for going on.  On the basis of this \u201cVanya,\u201d no one should ever again try to convince you that Chekhov is a delicate flower.

Then, Sullivan\u2019s parents asked her and her two younger brothers to sit down for a family discussion. \u201cThey were like, \u2018We are getting divorced,\u2019\u2009\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThey just told us, and no one wanted to talk from there.\u201d Sullivan ran upstairs in tears, lay on her bed and tried to figure out what it all meant. She was already worried about college, and now this.  She suddenly had a whole new set of unknowns: What if her brothers couldn\u2019t deal with this without her? What if she had to transfer to a school closer to home? What if her parents fought in front of her roommate? And where would she live during breaks? The questions ran through her mind as she packed and rode the train to Washington with her mother. Her father drove separately.  The first day was easier than she thought it would be, and her parents got along so well that her new neighbors assumed they were happily married. The first few weeks also went smoothly. Sullivan made the cut for an a cappella group and volunteered in the community with fellow freshmen. All of the girls on her floor would routinely hang out. \u201cIt\u2019s the honeymoon phase,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone loves each other. Everyone loves everyone on the floor.\u201d  Then, the summer camp feel began to wear off. Obligations and homework began to pile up, and Sullivan realized her roommate would never become her best friend. She kept getting pulled into drama at home. \u201cI felt guilty being away,\u201d she said. \u201cMy brothers would say: \u2018It\u2019s so unfair you\u2019re away at school.\u2019 I told them: \u2018Believe me, I\u2019m dealing with it here.\u2019\u2009\u201d Although her new friends likely weren\u2019t able to tell, Sullivan didn\u2019t feel like herself. She ate pizza for too many meals and didn\u2019t have energy for the gym. She cried a lot.  Then, she returned home at Thanksgiving. She walked into the house and burst into tears. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be home. I wanted to be back at school,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just felt so weird. My family was so different. It was like two different families.\u201d * * * The members of the incoming Class of 2015 have been lectured on the value of a college degree for most of their lives. But getting that degree has never been more expensive, especially at a time when some families are dealing with unemployment, cut wages and other financial hardships. Record numbers of freshmen are arriving on campus already stressed out, and campus resources are stretched thinner by demand.  After enduring the college application process, some students then feel pressured to succeed at everything: making friends, earning high grades, keeping scholarships, getting internships, leading clubs and posting happy photos on Facebook. They want the \u201cperfect\u201d college experience that leads to a dream career, even in a bad job market. \u201cI was just so worried that I would fail and screw up my whole life,\u201d said Danielle Piroutek, 19, a rising sophomore at Catholic University from rural South Dakota who struggled with intense homesickness her first year. \u201cPeople at home were asking about me, how I was doing. I didn\u2019t want to let them down.\u201d  The rigor of college classes can be daunting, but often the most challenging problems students face in their first year are social or emotional. If students are happy and comfortable in their new environment, studies show, they are more likely to do well in class. Most students deal with at least one major disappointment or setback their first semester: rejection by a student organization, a failed test or marked-up term paper, heartbreak, fights with friends or homesickness.  In 2010, more than 10 percent of students at more than 300 four-year institutions sought some sort of counseling, according to a survey of counseling center directors. These students are seeking help with issues including depression, sexual identity, eating disorders, sexual assault, anxiety, and drinking or drug dependency. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing students reaching out,\u201d said John Dages, director of the George Washington University counseling center, which has seen at least a 20 percent increase in traffic in the past couple years. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a minor issue, I\u2019m glad they\u2019re reaching out.\u201d  Many students work through these problems during a handful of appointments with a counselor, but some face issues that need long-term treatment. Not getting help increases the chance a student will take time off from school, transfer elsewhere or drop out. The stakes are high. Making it through the first-year of college dramatically increases a student\u2019s chances of graduating. Nationally, less than 60 percent of first-time students who start college graduate within six years, a statistic college presidents, education advocates and even President Obama are working to change.  In the past few years, many colleges have ramped up their freshmen orientation or created programs aimed at helping students through the ups and downs of their first year. A recurring message: Freshman year is difficult for everyone. You are not alone.  \u201cThey need to have these issues normalized. They need to realize that everyone is going through this,\u201d said Jonathan Mattanah, a psychology professor at Towson University who studies freshmen adjustment issues.\u201cIf you can keep students hooked into the community and more socially connected, they will do better.\u201d * * * As a high school student in Montgomery County, Staci Armezzani had a high-powered group of friends whose parents pushed them to succeed. She fought to prove herself and break the stereotype of being the ditzy cheerleader. Her parents were proud when she did her best, even if that didn\u2019t mean perfect grades. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t good enough for me,\u201d she said. Armezzani\u2019s top pick for a college was the University of Maryland, College Park, which rejected her. She got into Penn State, where her dad had almost gone when he was her age. Her football-loving relatives were equally excited, and she received piles of Penn State gear for graduation. \u201cAll of the people around me, who meant the most to me, were all excited about Penn State,\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t until Armezzani moved to campus on a Friday afternoon in August 2008 that she realized Penn State was not where she wanted to be. The campus was massive, and far from her family and boyfriend, who still had one year of high school left.  Her roommate spoke limited English, and Armezzani spent her first night crying and talking to her parents on the phone. A residence hall staffer encouraged Armezzani to wait until classes started on Monday. But concerned that she wouldn\u2019t be able to get her tuition back if she waited, Armezzani told her parents on Saturday morning that she had booked a Greyhound ticket.  This quick change of plans upset her parents \u2014 and her younger sister, who was attending a birthday party that day. They worried she was making this decision for her boyfriend and not for herself. They had a long discussion. \u201cThat\u2019s when the truth started to come out, that I had put a lot more pressure on myself than they ever had,\u201d she said.  Armezzani took \u201cPenn State\u201d off her Facebook profile and enrolled in classes at Montgomery College. She told a few friends that she had moved home, and their response was usually, \u201cWhy?\u201d After a year of community college classes, Armezzani transferred to Maryland. It was her original dream school. And yet she was miserable.  Like many freshmen, Armezzani was in search of a better college fit. But each time a student transfers, he or she becomes a new student on a strange campus. And without the camaraderie of a freshman class, it\u2019s easy to again feel disconnected.  \u201cFor better or for worse, transfer students are not like freshmen, in that they are wide and varied\u201d in their needs, said Britt Reynolds, a director of undergraduate admissions at Maryland. \u201cFreshmen are much more alike.\u201d Transfer students have often already had a freshman experience elsewhere, he said, or they are nontraditional students who don\u2019t want their orientation to include a sleepover in the dorms.  As a first-year transfer student, Armezzani hadn\u2019t bonded with the rest of her class in dorms and learning communities the year before. She lived in an apartment near campus and didn\u2019t have many friends other than her boyfriend, who had just started at Maryland. She thought about rushing a sorority, but found the Greek system overwhelming. She didn\u2019t want to drink or party, but that kept her from doing anything social. She went home nearly every weekend. Unlike at community college, her classes were held in huge lecture halls where the professors didn\u2019t know names and students sat in cliques.  \u201cTransfer students aren\u2019t any different than freshmen,\u201d she said. \u201cOut of every different group of students that Maryland has, transfer students are the ones who go unnoticed, who are most likely to fall through the cracks.\u201d  (Although Armezzani believes that Maryland could do more, admissions officials say they already have many programs in place to help transfer students. There\u2019s a program that lets students take a class on campus before formally enrolling, plus pre-transfer advising, an intense one-day orientation and ongoing events.) Armezzani contemplated dropping out. But her mother, who didn\u2019t finish college, urged her to stick with it and reminded her of the opportunities a degree would open. Armezzani requested an academic counselor to help build her confidence in difficult classes and decided to get involved with at least one activity during her second semester. She picked student government, which was looking for students to help with communications, her major at the time. As she started to build friendships with her fellow student leaders, she began to feel less like an outsider. Then, right before spring finals, she broke up with her boyfriend. It sent her into a tailspin. Her mom booked her an appointment with a therapist. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I was depressed or because I was suicidal. It was because I had no one else to talk to,\u201d Armezzani said. Her second year at Maryland, Armezzani lived at home and commuted to campus. But she finally had friendships, a leadership position in student government and reasons to stay in College Park until 2 a.m. She got involved with peer education classes for transfer students, where the most frequent question is how to get involved. During the summer, she coaches a community swim team and urges parents to not send their children too far from home unless they are truly ready. \u201cAt 18, they might not be ready to go away,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had that year at home, I probably would have fallen into the swamp of \u2018maybe college isn\u2019t for me.\u2019\u2009\u201d One night this summer, Armezzani told a group of friends about her first two years of college. She\u2019s at a point where she can joke about her 24 hours at Penn State. \u201cOne of my friends said, \u2018I would have had no idea that personality existed in this Staci that I now know,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Armezzani, who is now 21 and plans to graduate with her class in May with a criminal justice degree. \u201cI never thought three years ago that this is where I would be or that I would be so happy.\u201d * * * In a darkened auditorium at George Washington University late on a June night, a party rages as the refrain of a Lil\u2019 Jon song blares: \u201cShots shots shots shots shots! Everybody!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into Justin?\u201d a student wonders aloud as the drunken host staggers around, tries feeling up a woman he used to date and pressures his roommate to pop an Adderall.  It\u2019s all a skit, written and performed by students to show incoming freshmen situations that will likely come up. By the end, the roommate\u2019s heart raced from the Adderall, an intoxicated character had his stomach pumped, another faced legal charges for using a fake ID, students were busted for smoking pot in the dorms, and Justin had cemented a reputation as \u201cthat guy\u201d who parties too much.  \u201cEveryone makes mistakes,\u201d a character says. \u201cYou just have to learn from it.\u201d On most campuses, freshman orientation has become a standard requirement and a carefully choreographed production that can last days. It\u2019s often just the kickoff to a year of programming for students and their parents.  There are summer programs aimed at helping students build friendships and independence before school starts. Virginia Tech takes some incoming students to a nearby 4-H camp for three days of canoeing, hiking and talking about what\u2019s to come that fall. American University invites some freshmen to move to campus a week early to do service work around the city.  Living and learning communities have boomed in popularity, as schools group students in dorms according to their academic interests or backgrounds. Usually these students take at least one class together and attend campus events as a group, linking students\u2019 academic lives to their social lives.  Some schools extend orientation through the first semester with a required one-credit course that teaches study skills, shares access to resources and answers questions.  Sometimes, that education happens outside of the classroom. At the University of Richmond, a group of deans takes a pile of pizzas to the freshmen residence halls on some Friday nights early in the semester to answer a variety of questions, including how to get football tickets.  At GWU, each first-year student is assigned a \u201cGuide to Personal Success,\u201d a faculty member or upperclassman who is available to answer questions, listen to problems or meet up for lunch. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make a big school feel small,\u201d said Dean of Students Peter Konwerski. At GWU\u2019s freshman orientation, the skit about the perils of drinking ends with the message \u201cmake good decisions.\u201d There are skits about roommate conflicts, sexual assault, safe sex and the diversity of race, political affiliations and sexual orientation.  One of the final skits is about depression. A student stands before the audience and says: \u201cEverything in my life is going wrong, and I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d The student lacks motivation, sleeps a lot and is suddenly antisocial. She is frustrated that her dad just lost his job and quickly gets mad at her roommates. \u201cI just feel like no one understands what I\u2019m going through,\u201d she says, before agreeing to seek help. Her friends and family collect pieces of a shattered heart and patch it together.  * * * When Erin Sullivan returned to Catholic after Thanksgiving break, she finally took the advice of a friend and called the campus counseling center. Rather than just talking to friends during her worst days, she realized it might help to talk with someone during the okay days, too. She wanted to get back to her old self.  \u201cI just realized this isn\u2019t who I want to be,\u201d Sullivan said.  Once a week, she met with a counselor who mostly listened but also offered advice: Realize you are not the one who has to deal with this. Don\u2019t let this define your college years. Your parents sent you here to learn, not to worry about them. Focus on your relationship with your dad and your relationship with your mom, not their relationship. \u201cIt was like having a conversation with my parents or my friends, but there weren\u2019t any opinions,\u201d said Sullivan, 19, who is headed into her junior year. \u201cIt was just nice to have someone to talk to.\u201d And it helped her get back to her usual self. Toward the end of Sullivan\u2019s freshman year, she applied to be a residence hall assistant. This school year, she oversaw a floor of freshmen girls, mitigated roommate flare-ups and told students not to be ashamed to book a counseling appointment. Her parents\u2019 divorce was recently finalized, and, as she mentored students only a year younger than herself, Sullivan reflected on her own challenges.  \u201cWhen they would sit in my room,\u201d she said, \u201cI would be giving them this advice, and I\u2009would think, \u2018Wow, I should take this advice.\u2019 \u201d Jenna Johnson writes about campus life for The Washington Post.

He accuses currency traders for the bank of skimming profits of transactions conducted for six state and local public pension funds by falsely reporting the rate at which currency was exchanged.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe bank is disputing the claims and will fight them in court, a spokesman said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThe lawsuit filed by the Virginia attorney general is unwarranted and reflects a flawed understanding of foreign currency markets,\u201d Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine said. \u201cWe will fight these claims in court and are confident we will prevail. .\u2009.\u2009.While our first choice is always an amicable resolution, we refuse to be coerced into paying for and admitting to wrongdoing where none exists.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe lawsuit, filed in Fairfax County under the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, a 2002 statute designed to encourage whistleblowers to come forward, is one of the largest non-health-care cases brought anywhere in the nation, legal experts say.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the history of the federal version of the state law, there have been only two pharmaceutical cases that received more than $1\u00a0billion in damages and penalties. Both were brought by the U.S. Justice Department and more than 20 states.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCuccinelli intervened in January in a lawsuit filed by a private whistleblower that sought $150\u00a0million in damages from the Bank of New York Mellon, which has served as the master custodian of the Virginia Retirement System since 1988. After mediation failed last week, he filed a lawsuit.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe\u2019re always willing to listen, but, in our judgment, we reached a point where they just don\u2019t take their offense seriously,\u201d he said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the attorney general\u2019s office, the bank is paid $4.5\u00a0million a year to hold and protect Virginia\u2019s pensions. It manages $55.1 billion in state and local government retirement funds.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe suit was initiated by a Delaware-based partnership called FX Analytics, whose members, according to the legal complaint, had \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of the fraud based on \u201cextensive knowledge and experience\u201d with the Bank of New York Mellon.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThe damages in the attorney general\u2019s complaint are based on hard data and are not plucked from thin air for shock value,\u201d said Zachary Kitts, an attorney for FX Analytics.\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to Cuccinelli\u2019s office, the Bank of New York Mellon would watch currency markets and conduct trades on behalf of Virginia at the most advantageous price it could find during a trading day. But when the bank reported the results of the trade to the state, it would report that the state had received the day\u2019s least advantageous price. It would then pocket the difference, the lawsuit claims.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Virginia suit is similar to one filed in California in 2009 by then-Attorney General Jerry Brown (D) against State Street, seeking $200 million in damages over the same alleged foreign currency exchange practices. The California suit remains in litigation; State Street has denied wrongdoing. In October, Washington state announced that it had reached an $11.7 million settlement with State Street Bank, resolving a similar dispute.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn addition to the funds it holds for Virginia\u2019s pension fund, the Bank of New York Mellon is also paid $400,000 a year to serve in the same role for the $4.9 billion Fairfax retirement system and receives almost $136,000 annually from Arlington to serve as custodian of the county\u2019s $1.27 billion pension.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCuccinelli said he has received calls from officials in other states, which are now researching their pension funds contracts with Bank of New York Mellon.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkumaranita@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 17:44:03", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaldc-politicsvirginias-cuccinelli-sues-bank-of-new-york-mellon-alleging-pension-fraud20110811giqaktfg9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 206, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:31:22", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "headline": "AT&amp;T cell antennae opposed by Falls Church condominium residents", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/atandt-cell-antennae-opposed-by-falls-church-condominium-residents/2011/08/05/gIQAHjAc9I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tAt her condominium building in Falls Church, Sima Asgari briefly buttonholes her neighbors in the hallways and the lobby. She\u2019s on a mission to spread the word about AT&T\u2019s proposal to install cellular antennas on the complex\u2019s roof. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn a recent day, Asgari approached a resident on the elevator. \u201cHe had two small kids\u201d with him, she said. \u201cI asked him if he was worried.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat\u2019s because Asgari is worried. She and dozens of Skyline House residents say they are concerned about the health risks of radio frequency waves emitted from cellular broadcast antennas. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough researchers say the long-term health effects of cell towers are unknown, the residents are demanding that Skyline\u2019s condominium board drop its negotiations with AT&T. The uproar has led the board to schedule a town-hall-style meeting next month to address the proposal.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe company is offering Skyline House $24,000 a year to lease its rooftop for 25 years, according to residents. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAT&T is seeking to install nine antennas on Skyline\u2019s roof, said Gayle Kansagor, a company spokeswoman. The company wants to relocate a cellular broadcast unit that is installed on the roof of an Arlington County apartment building. Skyline\u2019s twin high-rises are taller and would provide better coverage, Kansagor said. The company wants to install the antennas on Skyline\u2019s east building. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cAT&T is constantly looking to improve coverage for its customers throughout the Washington, D.C., area and is always looking for more ways to invest in that network,\u201d she said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSkyline House, in the Bailey\u2019s Crossroads area, consists of two 18-story buildings connected by a reception area. Many of the board\u2019s decisions involve benign topics, such as how many umbrellas to buy for the pool or whether to power wash the parking garage. But the decision about whether to install cell antennas has galvanized this community of more than 2,400 residents. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDavid Green, who moved to Skyline three years ago, has started a petition opposing the cellular antennas. So far, he has collected about 50 signatures, he said, adding that half a dozen residents are going door to door to collect more. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreen compared cellular radiation to federally banned lead-based paint, whose safety hazards were not discovered until after its widespread use. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cMore assurances need to be made\u201d about any health risks, Green said. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExposure to radio waves also worries Aida Longo, who lives on the 10th floor and is trying to conceive. \u201cI don\u2019t want 20 years from now to get cancer,\u201d she said. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cEveryone is furious because this could be potential hazards to people\u2019s health.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to Kenneth Portier, managing director for statistics at the American Cancer Society, the radio waves are most likely not powerful enough to produce health risks.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA radio wave \u201cis very weak, and it\u2019s very spread out, so it\u2019s not concentrated,\u201d he said. \u201cThe exposures that people are typically to get are extremely low.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPortier said studies about possible health effects from cell towers are inconclusive, and it is an active area of research. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat uncertainty concerns Asgari, who said she would consider moving if the antennas are installed. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cLiving in doubt and worry is not worth it,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing may happen, but if you\u2019re worried something may happen, it ruins your life.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRooftop cellular antennas are becoming more common as wireless companies expand their coverage to keep up with growing data usage. Last year, Fairfax County approved the installation of 73 cellular antennas on top of residential and office buildings, including public facilities. That figure is up from nine antennas approved in 2006. The county has sanctioned 213 cellular antennas over the past five years. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSkyline already leases its rooftop to Sirius XM Radio, which has operated an antenna there since 2000, said Maria Elena Schacknies, the president of the condominium board. Schacknies said the AT&T lease would help fill a deficit caused by residents who have fallen behind on condominium fee payments. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAT&T and the Skyline board are negotiating a contract. But in response to residents\u2019 concerns, the board will host a community-wide meeting next month to discuss the proposal. Schacknies said she wants to invite health, science and technology experts to the meeting. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cI think people need to have an opportunity to listen to the experts,\u201d she said. \u201cBased on that, we can make informed decisions.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thoshk@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 14:57:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocalatandt-cell-antennae-opposed-by-falls-church-condominium-residents20110805giqahjac9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 207, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:31:23", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "headline": "Confederate soldier\u2019s diaries find a home at Washington and Lee University", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/confederate-soldiers-diaries-find-a-home-at-washington-and-lee-university/2011/08/11/gIQAteod9I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tCivil War buffs have read plenty about the derring-do of Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson. But they haven\u2019t read this account, written in summer 1861 after the little-known Battle of Hainesville:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe sat calmly on his horse & wrote a dispatch to Gen. Johnston, whilst the balls were flying thick around him, knocking up the dust, cutting down leaves from the trees &c.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThey are the words of Alexander Sterrett Paxton, a Virginia college student who joined the Confederate infantry and served in Jackson\u2019s storied Stonewall Brigade.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaxton\u2019s diaries \u2014 six of them, chronicling the conflict from beginning to end \u2014 surfaced at auction this summer. A group of donors raised the funds to purchase them for Washington and Lee University, where Paxton was a senior when the war erupted. Paxton marched off to fight with about 100 classmates, known to posterity as the Liberty Hall Volunteers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe diaries, previously unknown, add a new and articulate voice to the corpus of first-hand accounts of the war. They are a welcome addition to the Special Collections library at Washington and Lee, a quintessentially Virginian university, where Robert E. Lee once served as president.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe just knew that this was where these diaries needed to be,\u201d said David Klinestiver, an Indianapolis attorney and Civil War enthusiast who belongs to a group that reenacts battles fought by the Liberty Hall Volunteers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaxton grew up near Lexington and enrolled at the institution then known as Washington College, after George Washington, a key early donor. When Virginia seceded, students raised a Confederate flag. That drew a protest from President George Junkin, a Union loyalist. Faculty sided with the students, and Junkin fled.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese were men \u201cof the age that they would have been caught up in the furor and the rage of what was going on around them,\u201d said C.J. Roberts, a historian and fellow Civil War reenactor.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMany of the students knew Jackson personally: He was a fellow Lexingtonian and had held a teaching post at the neighboring Virginia Military Institute. So, in June 1861, they left in wagons and stagecoaches to meet up with the general in Winchester.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaxton began his account with this legend: Devoted to a brief history of the adventures, movements &c of the \u2018Liberty Hall Volunteers\u2019 during the war of Southern Independence & of resistance to Northern Despotism.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe wrote that he had joined the conflict because the peace & safety of our homes in the Old Dominion were threatened by the warlike preparations of Old Abe Lincoln.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA month later, the young infantryman found himself in the First Battle of Bull Run, on the battlefield where Jackson earned his nickname.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe wrote: The shells would burst over & around us scattering their fragments far & wide. And as we lay there prostrated on the ground the cannon balls from the enemy\u2019s guns would whiz just a few feet above our bodies, strike in front of our line & bounce over us, whilst the minie balls went singing by our ears & between our bodies.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaxton penciled a sketch of the battlefield. And he gave this account of Jackson:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhilst we were there Gen Jackson rode up & down the line as cool & calm as if on an evening parade, tho\u2019 the missiles of destruction flew around him as thick as hail. Now & then he would exclaim \u201cAlls well,\u201d & remarked \u201cThis night we will drive them across the Potomac.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the conflict wore on, Paxton remarked on the hardening of his own nature: Nothing is so exciting as to get a shot at a Yankee. How strange that the better & kinder feelings of our natures should be thus changed!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn May 1863, he described being wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville: Just as I fired my last shot, I was shot through the right leg about two inches above the knee. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaxton went home to recuperate. He returned that fall and fought with the Confederates till Lee\u2019s surrender in April 1865, when he observed, The very atmosphere breathes of bad news.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe diaries remained in private hands until June, when Paxton\u2019s descendants put them up for auction. The Washington and Lee library lacked the funds to raise the purchase price, so Roberts and Klinestiver organized a group of 11 donors, including several alumni. They bought the diaries for about $21,000 on June 23 and delivered them to the Lexington campus July 22.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cOur alumni rose to the occasion rather marvelously,\u201d said Vaughan Stanley, special collections librarian at the university. He also praised the reenactors who contributed.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome of the six volumes are store-bought pocket journals. Later on, as supplies dwindled, Paxton resorted to binding pages by hand, using scraps of discarded military forms and bits of leather and string.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEarly entries are lengthy and detailed. Later entries are fewer and plainer, some of them \u201cclearly written in haste,\u201d Klinestiver said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaxton returned home after the war. He eventually became principal of a girl\u2019s school in Kentucky and wrote a long-forgotten memoir of antebellum memories. He was, by all accounts, a Confederate patriot to the end.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead more: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCivil War blog: A House Divided\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWilson\u2019s Creek reenactment to draw thousands this weekend\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCivil War statue dedicated 100 years late\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdevised@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 16:56:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaleducationconfederate-soldiers-diaries-find-a-home-at-washington-and-lee-university20110811giqateod9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 209, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "headline": "Forecast: Delightfully mild, and still dry... for now", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/forecast-delightfully-mild-and-still-dry-for-now/2011/07/07/gIQAP16x9I_blog.html?wprss=capital-weather-gang", "content": "<p>\n<i>Live Weather Updates from <a href=\"http://twitter.com/capitalweather\">CWG\u2019s Twitter Feed</a>.

PEACOCK ROOM  The Peacock Room has never looked this good. Well, maybe it did one day in the spring of 1908.  That\u2019s when art collector Charles Lang Freer had photos taken of the room, whose furnishings he had purchased a few years earlier and transported from the home of a wealthy Londoner to his mansion in Detroit. In London, the room (designed by painter James McNeill Whistler) was a showcase for Chinese blue-and-white porcelain, and nothing else. Freer turned it into a showcase for a variety of ceramics from not just China, but also from Japan, Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Iran and Korea, and in every color of the rainbow.  In more recent years, long after Freer moved his art collection to the museum that bears his name, the museum restored the Peacock Room to the way it was in London.  This spring, the room \u2014 named for the subject of a Whistler painting that hangs there \u2014 got an extreme makeover. The 81 pieces of blue-and-white porcelain that had long decorated its shelves have been replaced with 254 items of exquisitely mismatched pottery. Piece for piece, it\u2019s a duplicate of the way it looked in 1908, in Freer\u2019s house. If it sounds a bit chockablock, it is, without being a jumble. Freer never meant the room to be a museum piece, however, but an aesthetic laboratory.  Beginning Aug. 18, the museum plans a special treat. Every third Thursday, it will open the room\u2019s window shutters between noon and 5 p.m., casting Freer\u2019s vision in an even better light. Through spring of 2013.

Normally a museum no-no, the single lit candle is the centerpiece of a tightly focused \u2014 though surprisingly expansive \u2014 exhibition of works by video artist Nam June Paik. Shot by a live, closed-circuit video camera, the flame appears, via multiple projectors, in flickering mirror images all around the darkened room, turning the space into a chapel of sorts. The spiritual allusion is fitting. The show also includes two equally cosmic video works. One centers on a statue of the Buddha; the other, a simple egg.

POPE-LEIGHEY HOUSE  It\u2019s tempting to describe the area\u2019s only Frank Lloyd Wright-designed home that\u2019s open to the public as a jewel box. At a mere 1,200 square feet and with a hallway built to the same tight specs as the corridor of a train\u2019s sleeping car, its compact chambers do contain marvels: abstract, cutout window forms; an elegant cantilvered roof, subtly varied colors and textures.  But it\u2019s the building as a whole that\u2019s the gem. Built in 1940 of cypress, brick, glass and concrete \u2014 and with nearly every detail, including the furniture and the orientation of screw heads, overseen by its control-freak architect \u2014 the house is a triumph of obsessiveness.

Oliveira\u2019s muscular sculpture looks like the roots of a giant, invasive plant, or perhaps a massive tumor,  that has burst through the walls of the National Museum of African Art, where the two men are showing side by side.  They\u2019re a good match. The wild, destructive energy of Oliveira\u2019s art is matched by Zulu\u2019s 2-D abstractions, which the artist creates with carefully controlled fire.

The committee\u2019s report could ease the way for greater domestic gas exploration, even as it calls for new standards to limit harmful air emissions that bring to the surface gas buried deep in shale formations. But the report is largely silent on the most contentious issue surrounding shale gas exploration: who should regulate it, and whether regulators should apply to it laws such as the Safe Drinking Water Act. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping massive amounts of fluid \u2014 a mixture of water and chemicals \u2014 underground, which cracks the shale and drives the gas to the surface. With major deposits in several regions of the country, including  the Northeast and the Midwest, firms are tapping into the resource at an unprecedented rate. Shale gas accounted for less than 2\u00a0percent of total U.S. natural-gas production in 2001; it is now close to 30\u00a0percent, and the Energy Information Administration projects that it will amount to 45\u00a0percent of domestic production by 2035. As drilling activity has moved closer to residential areas \u2014 and as some researchers have found unusually high methane concentrations in nearby drinking water \u2014 local activists have called for a stop to further drilling. But industry officials, many politicians and some environmentalists have argued that the country must exploit a domestic energy source that does not release as much carbon dioxide as other fossil fuels when burned.  John Deutch, a chemistry professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who chaired the advisory panel, said in an interview that the group offered \u201ca different approach\u201d to overseeing fracking. \u201cYou measure, you disclose what you measure, and you use these measurements to improve the way you operate in the field and reduce your environmental impact,\u201d he said. Said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund and another panel member: \u201cIf the recommendations are adopted, shale gas resources in the United States will be tapped in a way that avoids some of the environmental problems that have cropped up so far, and minimizes and recognizes others.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is now a path for industry to act, and regulators to act, to avert the looming impasse over shale gas development.\u201d The group\u2019s recommendations will go to Energy Secretary Steven Chu, whose department does not regulate natural-gas production. But its advice, which covers potential actions by regulators and industry, could carry political weight because President Obama asked Chu to establish the advisory group. On Wednesday, the Environmental Working Group released a letter signed by 28 scientists objecting to the panel, noting that six of its members had connections to industry and that Deutch serves on the board of the natural-gas firm Cheniere Energy and was paid more than $1.4\u00a0million by that company and Schlumberger. between 2006 and 2009. Deutch said he fully disclosed his background before Chu selected him. The panel\u2019s report calls for full disclosure of the chemicals used in fracturing liquids, along with \u201cadoption of rigorous emission standards for both new and existing sources for methane, air toxics, ozone-forming pollutants and other major airborne contaminants,\u201d although it does not specify whether state or federal regulators should impose those rules. The Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates air and water quality, is conducting its own study of  fracking\u2019s effect on the environment and public health. EPA spokeswoman Betsaida Alcantara said that the agency is reviewing the panel\u2019s recommendations and that it will issue an initial report of its findings in 2012. The advisory panel emphasizes enhanced monitoring of fracking activities, including establishing a baseline for local water quality, studying the extent to which methane could migrate from drilling sites to nearby wells, and public disclosure of air pollution emissions from shale gas operations.  The report also stresses the importance of the industry adopting \u201cbest practices,\u201d a technique that offshore oil and gas operators have used for years, to ensure safe shale gas extraction. Shell, for example, issued principles in June aimed at setting a standard that the firms could follow, although it does not disclose all the elements in fracking fluid because suppliers say that doing so would disclose trade secrets. Although some of the group\u2019s recommendations would go further than rules that states have adopted for fracking \u2014 Texas, for instance, requires firms to disclose some but not all chemicals in fracking fluid \u2014 several of its proposals fall in line with what state and industry officials are already doing.  Industry experts such as Howard L. Boigon, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells who represents the oil and gas industry, said the report covers areas where operators \u201chave either been giving ground or are moving toward.\u201d  The Independent Petroleum Association of America said that \u201cthe report stands in stark contrast to the strident, hysterical demands for moratoria on hydraulic fracturing.\u201d But groups such as Friends of the Earth \u2014 which joined 67 other organizations in asking Obama on Monday to impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing \u2014 questioned why the panel would issue a report when the EPA was in the midst of a multi-year study. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about this 90-day rush to judgment that\u2019s just inappropriate,\u201d said Damon Moglen, who directs climate and energy policy for Friends of the Earth.  eilperinj@washpost.com Staff writer Steven Mufson contributed to this report.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 21:08:55", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomnationalhealth-scienceenergy-department-panel-to-endorse-shale-gas-exploration20110810giqaxqbh7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 211, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "headline": "Featured Advertiser", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/02672ad895df0493aead55241055b58d", "content": "<a href=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/click.phdo?s=02672ad895df0493aead55241055b58d&amp;p=4\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/img.phdo?s=02672ad895df0493aead55241055b58d&amp;p=4\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-12 07:56:00", "guid": "false", "slug": "httpfeedswashingtonpostcomrss02672ad895df0493aead55241055b58d"}}, {"pk": 212, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:31:26", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:09", "headline": "Note to readers: Technical issues on washingtonpost.com", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/note-to-readers-technical-issues-on-washingtonpostcom/2011/08/11/gIQAi5X08I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tNote to Readers:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome of you may have come across \u201cinvalid URL\u201d messages on some links on our site or experienced problems with using your log-in and password.

The plan would require congressional approval but, if successful, could be precedent-setting, with possible ripple effects throughout government. It would also deliver a major blow to the nation\u2019s labor movement.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a notice informing employees of its proposals \u2014 with the headline \u201cFinancial crisis calls for significant actions\u201d \u2014 the Postal Service said, \u201cWe will be insolvent next month due to significant declines in mail volume and retiree health benefit pre-funding costs imposed by Congress.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDuring the past four years, the service lost $20 billion, including $8.5 billion in fiscal 2010. Over that period, mail volume dropped by 20 percent.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe USPS plan is described in two draft documents obtained by The Washington Post. A \u201cWorkforce Optimization\u201d paper acknowledges its \u201cextraordinary request\u201d to break its labor contracts.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cHowever, exceptional circumstances require exceptional remedies,\u201d the document says.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThe Postal Service is facing dire economic challenges that threaten its very existence. .\u2009.\u2009. If the Postal Service was a private sector business, it would have filed for bankruptcy and utilized the reorganization process to restructure its labor agreements to reflect the new financial reality,\u201d the document continues.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a white paper on health and retirement benefits, the USPS said it was imperative to rein in health benefit and pension costs, which are a third of its labor expenses.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor health insurance plans, the paper said, the Postal Service wanted to withdraw its 480,000 pensioners and 600,000 active employees from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program \u201cand place them in a new, Postal Service administered\u201d program.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlmost identical language is used for the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees Retirement System.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe USPS said the programs do not meet \u201cthe private sector comparability standard,\u201d a statement that could be translated as meaning that government plans are too generous and too costly.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cFEHB may exceed what the private sector does in certain areas,\u201d said Anthony J. Vegliante, USPS chief human resources officer and executive vice president. \u201cIt may not meet what the private sector does in other areas. So cost may be above the private sector, while value may be below the private sector.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBills that would rein in employee benefits or have workers pay more for the benefits have been introduced in Congress and met with vigorous opposition from federal employee organizations. Intentionally or not, the Postal Service\u2019s proposal provides support for such legislative initiatives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe proposals are the USPS\u2019s latest money-saving effort in a series of moves, some as recent as a few weeks ago and others stretching over a decade. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Postal Service has reduced its workforce by 212,000 positions in the past 10 years and recently announced it is considering the closing of 3,700 post offices. It also has asked Congress to allow it to deliver mail five days a week instead of six and to change a requirement that it pre-fund retiree health benefits.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe USPS said it needs to reduce its workforce by 120,000 career positions by 2015, from a total of about 563,400, on top of the 100,000 it expects by attrition. Some of the 120,000 could come through buyouts and other programs, but a significant number would probably result from layoffs if Congress allows the agency to circumvent union contracts.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cUnfortunately, the collective bargaining agreements between the Postal Service and our unionized employees contain layoff restrictions that make it impossible to reduce the size of our workforce by the amount required by 2015,\u201d according to the optimization document. \u201cTherefore, a legislative change is needed to eliminate the layoff protections in our collective bargaining agreements.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe layoff protection, however, does not apply to employees with fewer than six years of service, which presumably would include thousands of workers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPostal union leaders quickly and sharply rejected the plans.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThe APWU will vehemently oppose any attempt to destroy the collective bargaining rights of postal employees or tamper with our recently negotiated contract \u2014 whether by postal management or members of Congress,\u201d American Postal Workers Union President Cliff Guffey said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cOur advisers are not encouraging us at all to even consider it,\u201d said National Rural Letter Carriers\u2019 Association President Don Cantriel.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe are absolutely opposed\u201d to the layoff proposal, he said. \u201cWe are opposed to pulling out of the Federal Employees Health Benefits plan.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNational Association of Letter Carriers President Fredric V. Rolando said: \u201cThe issues of lay-off protection and health benefits are specifically covered by our contract. .\u2009.\u2009. The Congress of the United States does not engage in contract negotiations with unions, and we do not believe they are about to do so.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow Congress will respond to the proposals, however, remains to be seen. Many Republicans, including those who have sponsored legislation that labor considers anti-union, may support the plan. Some Democrats, for which organized labor is an ally, could back union opposition. But the Postal Service\u2019s critical financial situation could make some Democrats have second thoughts.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwo members of Congress who have introduced separate postal reform bills were noncommittal on the USPS plan.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA spokeswoman for Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) said, \u201cHe is particularly interested in learning whether these proposals would be fair to employees and effective in reducing the Postal Service\u2019s costs.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said: \u201cThese new ideas from the Postal Service are worth exploring. Options for reform and cost savings that will protect taxpayers from paying for a bailout, now or in the future, need to be on the table.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead more on PostPolitics.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Fed Page\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRomney: \u2018Corporations are people\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElizabeth Warren weighing Senate bid\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfederaldiary@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 17:24:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsusps-proposes-cutting-120000-jobs-pulling-out-of-health-care-plan20110811giqazxim9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 87, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 09:56:11", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Let\u2019s make a deal for an economic recovery", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/post/lets-make-a-deal-for-an-economic-recovery/2010/12/20/gIQAKlTTvI_blog.html?wprss=innovations", "content": "<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Daily deal sites like Groupon, which first burst onto the scene a little over two years ago, have now become one of the most popular website concepts around. <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20110802/groupon-clones-struggle-to-compete-but-are-ripe-for-acquiring/\">\"Groupon Clones\"</a> have multiplied like sun umbrellas at the beach, while big-time Internet competitors like Facebook, Amazon and Google have all sought entry into what appears to be a lucrative, if increasingly crowded, market niche.

Former Luzerne County Judge Mark Ciavarella Jr. was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison for taking a $1 million bribe from the builder of a pair of juvenile detention centers in a case that became known as \u201ckids for cash.\u201d Ciavarella, who denied locking up youths for money, had no reaction as the sentence was announced. From the gallery, which was crowded with family members of some of the children he incarcerated, someone shouted \u201cWoo hoo!\u201d In the wake of the scandal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned about 4,000 convictions issued by Ciavarella between 2003 and 2008, saying he violated the constitutional rights of the juveniles, including the right to legal counsel and the right to intelligently enter a plea. Ciavarella, 61, was tried and convicted of racketeering earlier this year. His attorneys had asked for a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence in court papers, saying, in effect, that he\u2019d already been punished enough.  \u201cThe media attention to this matter has exceeded coverage given to many and almost all capital murders, and despite protestation, he will forever be unjustly branded as the \u2018Kids for Cash\u2019 judge,\u201d their sentencing memo said. Al Flora, Ciavarella\u2019s lawyer, called the sentence harsher than expected. The ex-judge surrendered immediately but it was not immediately known where he would serve his time. He plans to appeal both his conviction and sentence. Ciavarella, in a 15-minute speech before the sentence was handed down, apologized to his family, the Luzerne County bar and the community \u2014 and to those juveniles who appeared before him in his court. He called himself a hypocrite who failed to practice what he preached.  \u201cI blame no one but myself for what happened,\u201d he said. Then, in an extraordinary turnabout, Ciavarella attacked the government\u2019s case as well as the conclusions of the state Supreme Court and the Interbranch Commission on Juvenile Justice, a state panel that investigated the scandal. Both said Ciavarella engaged in wholesale rights violations over a period of many years. Ciavarella denied it.  \u201cI did everything I was obligated to do protect these children\u2019s rights,\u201d he said. He also criticized Assistant U.S. Attorney Gordon Zubrod for referring to the case as \u201ckids for cash,\u201d saying it sank his reputation. (Zubrod said outside court that he doesn\u2019t remember ever calling it that.)  \u201cHe backdoored me, and I never saw it coming. Those three words made me the personification of evil,\u201d Ciavarella said. \u201cThey made me toxic and caused a public uproar the likes of which this community has never seen.\u201d In court, Zubrod said Ciavarella had \u201cverbally abused and cruelly mocked children he sent away after violating their rights.\u201d He called the ex-judge \u201cvicious and mean-spirited\u201d and asked U.S. District Judge Edwin M. Kosik to punish Ciavarella\u2019s \u201cprofound evil\u201d with a life sentence.  \u201cThe criminal justice system (in Luzerne County) is ruined and will not recover in our lifetimes,\u201d Zubrod added. Federal prosecutors accused Ciavarella and a second judge, Michael Conahan, of taking more than $2 million in bribes from Robert Mericle, the builder of the PA Child Care and Western PA Child Care detention centers, and of extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars from Robert Powell, the facilities\u2019 co-owner. Ciavarella, known for his harsh and autocratic courtroom demeanor, pocketed the cash while filling the beds of the private lockups with children as young as 10, many of them first-time offenders convicted of petty theft and other minor crimes. Ciavarella often ordered youths he had found delinquent to be immediately shackled, handcuffed and taken away without giving them a chance to say goodbye to their families.  \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t think Ciavarella or Conahan themselves really personally cared where the juveniles went, as long as they could use their power to place the juveniles as leverage or control over Mericle and Powell,\u201d U.S. Attorney Peter Smith said Thursday. Speaking of Ciavarella, Smith added: \u201cThere\u2019s no true remorse and there\u2019s a blind unwillingness to admit the overall seriousness of his conduct.\u201d The jury returned a mixed verdict following a February trial, convicting Ciavarella of 12 counts, including racketeering and conspiracy, and acquitting him of 27 counts, including extortion. The guilty verdicts related to a payment of $997,600 from Mericle. Conahan pleaded guilty last year and awaits sentencing. Sandy Fonzo, whose son committed suicide last year at the age of 23 after bouncing in and out of Ciavarella\u2019s courtroom, said Thursday that justice was done.  \u201cThis judge was wrong, what he did to my son, what he did to all of our children, what he did to our families, and today proves that,\u201d said Fonzo, who dramatically confronted Ciavarella on the courthouse steps earlier this year. Susan Mishanski also applauded the sentence. Ciavarella had ordered her son to spend three months in a wilderness camp for scuffling with another kid.  \u201cThey did not even tell him where they were taking him. It was like someone kidnapped my son,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was awful.\u201d Ciavarella and Conahan initially pleaded guilty in February 2009 to honest services fraud and tax evasion in a deal that called for a sentence of more than seven years in prison. But their plea deals were rejected by Kosik, who ruled they had failed to accept responsibility for their actions. Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Jason Chaffetz fiercely opposed a debt-limit bill that took a significant swipe at the nation\u2019s deficit and had no new taxes, bucking the GOP leadership at nearly every turn. So did Chaffetz get catcalls for his defiance at a town hall in this heavily Republican rural Utah town? Hardly. The two-term lawmaker heard applause, attaboys and thank-yous from the nearly 50 people who gathered at a natural history museum on a Monday morning. Polls show a nation evenly divided over last week\u2019s emergency legislation that averted an unprecedented government default, cut spending by more than $2 trillion and raised the debt ceiling by nearly the same amount. But among tea partyers, who hold considerable sway within the GOP, the bill was highly unpopular, with nearly two-thirds arguing that the deal hammered out by President Barack Obama and congressional leaders did not go far enough in slashing government spending.  \u201cOne of the most powerful words in the English language is \u2018no,\u2019\u201d said 72-year-old Jerry Stotler of Ferron, Utah, who attended Chaffetz\u2019s town hall. \u201cThe tea party has failed to use their power of \u2018no.\u2019 If they would\u2019ve just stood strong on their principles, this (compromise) wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d Republican resistance to the bill wasn\u2019t lost on Chaffetz, who is weighing a 2012 challenge to six-term Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch \u2014 another vote against the debt-limit bill. And it had to register with Rep. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is looking to replace retiring GOP Sen. Jon Kyl, and Rep. Denny Rehberg, R-Mont., who hopes to oust Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. Flake and Rehberg were \u201cno\u201d votes, too. In fact, while House Republicans overwhelmingly backed the legislation \u2014 174 voted for it \u2014 several who have set their sights on the Senate opposed it, arguing that the bill was packed with budget gimmicks, lacked sufficient spending cuts and delayed harsh decisions needed to put the nation on the right fiscal track. They rebuffed their leaders, especially House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who negotiated with Obama and secured a major concession from the Democratic president \u2014 no tax increases.  \u201cWith $14 trillion in deficit spending, we need game-changing legislation,\u201d Chaffetz has said of his vote. The debt-limit bill wasn\u2019t it, he added. Rehberg, in a statement, called the new law \u201cwell-intentioned\u201d but \u201clittle more than business as usual for Washington.\u201d Flake said it was the \u201cage-old trick in Washington\u201d of producing a 10-year budget with deep cuts occurring in the later years. Flake said the bill should have had stronger language on amending the Constitution to require Congress and the president to produce balanced federal budgets. The bill provides that the House and Senate only have to vote on such an amendment by the end of the year. Approval would require a two-thirds majority in both houses. Three-fourths of the state legislatures would then have to ratify it.  \u201cWe should have passed some form of cap and balance, or at least if we\u2019re giving up other things ... have something to signal to people across the country and to the markets that we\u2019re serious about this deficit,\u201d Flake said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd I just don\u2019t view this deal we signed as serious.\u201d Among his constituents in the solidly Republican district east of Phoenix, \u201cthe overwhelming responses I hear are, \u2018This is not a good deal, you should have cut more,\u2019\u201d said the six-term congressman. With the Treasury Department announcing Wednesday that the U.S. budget deficit has topped $1 trillion for a third straight year, the clamor to slash spending is certain to grow louder among tea partyers and conservative Republicans unhappy with the debt-limit bill. GOP lawmakers seeking re-election next year, or looking to move up, know their vote will resonate with voters in 2012.  \u201cIf you\u2019re a Republican up for election next year \u2014 especially if you\u2019re running for the Senate \u2014 you have to think hard about Republican primary voters, who oppose the debt deal,\u201d said John J. Pitney Jr., a professor of American politics at Claremont McKenna College.  \u201cPolitically, a \u2018no\u2019 vote is a lot safer than a \u2018yes\u2019 vote,\u201d Pitney said. This is especially true in Utah, where the GOP Senate nominee is decided at a state convention that\u2019s far more insular than a primary. In spring 2010, tea partyers led the way in sacking longtime conservative Sen. Robert Bennett at a party convention. Republican Mike Lee, with the support of the tea party movement, won the Senate seat. Chaffetz had four town halls on tap this week, with only one in his congressional district as he looks ahead to a possible Senate bid. Among the people who turned out, he got high marks for resisting the leadership.  \u201cWhat he says is backed up by his votes,\u201d said Brian Dawes, 40, of Castle Dale. \u201cI want our representatives to be bold and willing to stand strong, instead of just trying to get re-elected.\u201d Chaffetz may get several other spending votes. The budget runs out on Sept. 30 and Congress will have to decide on another spending bill in the face of a government shutdown. The debt-limit legislation establishes a \u201csupercommittee\u201d of 12 lawmakers who will try to come up with at least $1.2 trillion more in deficit cuts over the next 10 years, including possible cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security as well as revenue from tax increases. The House may vote on that plan. Chaffetz said he couldn\u2019t back a measure with more taxes.  \u201cWe\u2019re not one good tax increase away from prosperity,\u201d he told the town hall. ____ Cassata reported from Washington.

Meanwhile, Blair Lee ran for the governorship in 1978 but lost a Democratic primary battle to Harry Hughes, a former Maryland secretary of transportation. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen her husband became Maryland\u2019s chief executive, Mrs. Lee could not ignore the circumstance but largely dismissed the pomp. She declared politics mostly \u201cfrivolous,\u201d explaining that she preferred to focus her energies on \u201ccommon-sense\u201d activities.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShe stayed at the family home in Silver Spring while her husband settled into the governor\u2019s mansion in Annapolis. By all accounts, they remained devoted to each other, but she struck a decidedly independent path. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShe said she cared little for the formal lunches and fashion-show appearances expected of governors\u2019 wives. She said it reminded her too much of the dutiful, embassy-centered social life she knew as a child.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShe said she would limit her role in Annapolis to only the most \u201cnecessary\u201d meetings. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m that vital to Blair\u2019s political life,\u201d she told The Washington Post in 1977. \u201cHe\u2019s quite a capable person. After all, he\u2019s the governor, not me.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShe continued pursuing a schedule centered on volunteer responsibilities for the American Red Cross, the March of Dimes and Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring. She also conducted swimming lessons for the handicapped when not taking up new interests such as yoga.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHer preferred wardrobe was blue jeans, denim work shirts and sneakers. The Post noted that she carted around a bag lunch and canoe paddles from the back of an old station wagon.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMathilde Boal was born in Washington on May 1, 1920. Her father, Pierre, was a career diplomat and served as U.S. ambassador to Bolivia in the early 1940s. Her mother was French. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShe was a 1943 graduate of Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where she graduated cum laude with a degree in chemistry. She briefly worked in Colombia as a chemist for the Rockefeller Foundation before her marriage.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBlair Lee died in 1985, and their son Pierre B. Lee died in 1973. Survivors include seven children, Blair Lee IV of Silver Spring, Joseph W. Lee of Old Fields, W.Va, Christopher G. Lee of Boalsburg, Pa., Erica B. Lee of Corvallis, Mont., Philip L. Lee of Potomac, John F. Lee of Brookeville and Jenny Sataloff of Baltimore; a sister; 19 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile raising her children, Mrs. Lee was a Girl Scout leader, skier, camper, canoeist and swim instructor. She learned carpentry when her children\u2019s bedrooms needed remodeling, and she owned and operated her own chain saw and professional-grade limb chipper. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLater, she set state and national Senior Olympics records and hiked in the Pyrenees at 70.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen her husband was governor, Mrs. Lee made weekly trips to Annapolis and, once there, was known to inhabit the role of first lady with grace and charm. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShe did express her dismay, however, at having to cancel a white-water canoe trip on the Shenandoah River to accommodate a visit to Maryland by Princess Anne of England. But, she told The Post, the day turned out to be \u201clovely\u201d after all.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbernsteina@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 15:06:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocalobituariesmimi-lee-wife-of-former-maryland-governor-blair-lee-iii-dies-at-9120110811giqauzlu9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 222, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:10", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:10", "headline": "Are 21st century 5-year-olds cognitively ready to read?", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/are-21st-century-5-year-olds-cognitively-ready-to-read/2011/08/11/gIQAV3Vm9I_blog.html?wprss=answer-sheet", "content": "<p>This<i> was written by Elfrieda (Freddy) H.

LOUIS \u2014 Municipal bond broker Lucy Nobbe was fed up with Congress and angry over the U.S. credit downgrade, and she wanted the world to know. So the self-described Midwestern mom hired a plane to fly a banner over New York City with a message blaming federal lawmakers for the downgrade \u2014 and making herself something of a populist hero in the process.  \u201cI\u2019m just so overwhelmed,\u201d Nobbe, a 51-year-old divorced mother of two, said Wednesday of her new-found celebrity and the largely positive response to her protest. \u201cI had no idea it would make that big of an impact.\u201d Nobbe\u2019s anger bubbled over on Friday when Standard & Poor\u2019s announced that it was cutting the U.S. credit rating, a move that set off a volatile week for the stock market and escalated concerns that the country could be heading back into a recession. So she went on the Internet, found a pilot, and hired him to fly a banner over New York at lunchtime Tuesday with a message for Congress stating in large red letters: \u201cTHANKS FOR THE DOWNGRADE. YOU SHOULD ALL BE FIRED!\u201d  \u201cMy friends and I were ranting and raving ever since we heard about the downgrade,\u201d she said in a telephone interview from her home in the St. Louis suburb of Kirkwood. \u201cI work in municipal bonds so I know the consequences, and it made me even madder.\u201d The sentiment seemed to connect with many people frustrated by the sour economy, the near-shutdown of the government, the stuttering stock market and increasing debt. Nobbe\u2019s banner created an immediate online stir and turned heads on Wall Street. It also created confusion \u2014 some onlookers, bloggers and journalists thought it was aimed at New York-based S&P. Nobbe said it was strictly meant for Congress \u2014 both Democrats and Republicans. She initially wanted the plane to fly over Washington, D.C., but was told it couldn\u2019t because of air restrictions.  \u201cI\u2019m very apolitical,\u201d Nobbe said. \u201cBut the fact that they won\u2019t compromise angered me. They\u2019re acting like children. They leave the place in a shambles and go on vacation. It causes the market to crash.  \u201cI know they\u2019re tough issues, but they have to be dealt with. Get us back in financial shape,\u201d Nobbe said. Less than five minutes after the brief flight over New York, Nobbe received a call from Fortune magazine asking if she was responsible. She had hoped to remain anonymous and wasn\u2019t sure how her name was leaked. By Tuesday evening, she was getting flooded with calls, some from journalists but many from well-wishers.  \u201cI\u2019ve had individual people calling me going, \u2018Bravo,\u2019 \u2018thanks,\u2019 \u2018good job,\u2019\u201d Nobbe said. The praise isn\u2019t enough to spur Nobbe into considering her own foray into politics, but she would consider a follow-up banner if Congress helps get the economy back on track.  \u201cI\u2019d be happy to send an applaud message if they make it right,\u201d she said.

The problem occurred during the critical point of transition to aerodynamic flight, DARPA said in a statement that described the mission as an attempt to fly the fastest aircraft ever built.  \u201cMore than nine minutes of data was collected before an anomaly caused loss of signal,\u201d it said. \u201cInitial indications are that the aircraft impacted the Pacific Ocean along the planned flight path.\u201d The 7:45 a.m. launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, 130 miles northwest of Los Angeles, was the second of two planned flights of a Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle-2. Contact was also lost during the first mission. Shaped like the tip of a spear, the small craft is part of a U.S. military initiative to develop technology to respond to threats at 20 times the speed of sound or greater, reaching any part of the globe in an hour. The HTV-2 is designed to be launched to the edge of space, separate from its booster and maneuver through the atmosphere at 13,000 mph before intentionally crashing into the ocean. Defense analyst John Pike of Globalsecurity.org wasn\u2019t surprised with the latest failure because the hypersonic test flight program is still in its infancy.  \u201cAt this early stage of the game, if they did not experience failures, it\u2019s because they\u2019re not trying very hard,\u201d he said. Pike said it\u2019s possible for engineers to still glean useful information about what worked and what didn\u2019t, despite the flight ending prematurely. The key is to analyze what happened in the final five seconds before contact was lost. DARPA used Twitter to announce the launch and status of the flight. The agency said the launch of the Minotaur 4 rocket was successful and separation was confirmed via a camera. Communication was then lost. DARPA\u2019s statement quoted Air Force Maj. Chris Schulz, the HTV-2 program manager, on the challenge of flight in \u201cvirtually uncharted territory.\u201d  \u201cWe know how to boost the aircraft to near space,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know how to insert the aircraft into atmospheric hypersonic flight. We do not yet know how to achieve the desired control during the aerodynamic phase of flight. It\u2019s vexing; I\u2019m confident there is a solution. We have to find it.\u201d A team of experts will examine information gathered by more than 20 air, land, sea and space data collection systems, DARPA said. The HTV-2 is intended to put theory, simulations and wind tunnel experience to the test in real flight conditions at speeds producing temperatures in the thousands of degrees and requiring extremely fast control systems, according to DARPA. The first HTV-2 was launched on April 22, 2010. It returned nine minutes of data, including 139 seconds of aerodynamic data at speeds between 17 and 22 times the speed of sound, DARPA said. That craft detected an anomaly, aborted its flight and plunged into the ocean, the agency said. The military and NASA have also been working on powered aircraft capable of flying at speeds greater than five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5. In 2004, NASA\u2019s unmanned X-43A reached Mach 9.6 on a flight off California. Powered for 10 seconds by a supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet, that set a speed record for jet-powered flight. The X-43A also set the previous record of Mach 6.8 earlier that year. The unmanned X-51A Waverider, a demonstrator, developed by the Air Force, DARPA, Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and Boeing, has been tested twice. Powered by a scramjet, the first X-51A reached about Mach 5 for 140 seconds after being dropped from the wing of a B-52 in May 2010, according to Boeing. Last June, a second craft had problems in a flight off the California coast and the test was terminated. Two more flights are planned for the X-51A program. The HTV-2 was launched atop a Minotaur 4 rocket built by Orbital Sciences Corp. from decommissioned Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Minotaur 4 made its debut last year carrying the first HTV-2.  \u201cFrom what we can tell based on preliminary data, it looked like the rocket did its job,\u201d said Orbital spokesman Barry Beneski. Minotaur 4 is part of the Minotaur rocket family. There have been 22 Minotaur launches since 2000 \u2014 a 100 percent success rate. The price of a single flight ranges from $15 million to $30 million depending on the rocket style, according to the company. ___ AP Science Writer Alicia Chang contributed to this report.

Des Moines attorney Guy Cook declined to say how much the three \u2014 a young girl in Kentucky, a college student in Illinois and a retiree in upstate New York \u2014 were awarded at the settlement conference in Chicago on Monday. Their lawsuits claimed that the lounge chairs\u2019 legs are defective and snap forward, \u201cserving as a guillotine\u201d for fingers and hands caught between the legs and the chair. The chairs were designed and branded by Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and sold as part of patio furniture sets at Kmart stores. Cook first sued the two companies in 2008 on behalf of a magician and hand model who lost the tip of his finger to one of the chairs in Des Moines. That case was settled in early 2009. The dollar amounts awarded this week must remain confidential under the terms of the settlements, \u201cbut I can tell you that all of my clients are satisfied with the settlement in spite of the injuries they suffered,\u201d Cook said. The settlements were reached with Sandy Caffoe of Jamestown, N.Y., a 67-year-old who lost the function of her right hand when two fingers were amputated in 2008; college student Lisa Peterson, 22, of Des Plaines, Ill. who had her right ring finger amputated in 2009; and Kaitlyn Damron of Pikeville, Ky., who was four in 2006 when the tip of her left pinky finger was severed. Cook said Kmart continued to sell the chairs after he filed the original 2008 lawsuit but that they were later redesigned to add another bolt to the legs, preventing the snapping motion. He said he is investigating and pursuing other possible claims related to injuries from the chairs. Stewart denied anyone was injured by the chairs when a New York television reporter, Arnold Diaz, confronted her in 2009. Cook said he played video of that encounter during this week\u2019s settlement conference, which was overseen by a retired Cook County judge. Katherine Nash, a spokeswoman for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, and Kmart spokesman Chris Braithwaite declined to comment Thursday. ___ Associated Press writer Ryan J.

One hundred twenty-five years later, the Friday Morning Music Club is still presenting regular concerts by amateur musicians, has its own orchestra, holds the annual Washington International Competitions and is preparing to start its anniversary season with a gala concert on Sept. 24.  For a few weeks, however, the ladies of the FMMC \u2014 for the leadership is still nearly all women \u2014 thought they were going to usher in their 125th-anniversary season by lifting their concert Steinway out a window of their third-floor performance space with a crane.  This summer, the FMMC was evicted from its longtime home. Since 1990, the organization has been holding weekly concerts in a quiet, carpeted room on the third floor of the Charles Sumner School Museum, on 17th Street NW. The FMMC is used to relying on the kindness of strangers, having operated, throughout its history, at spaces all over Washington; the Sumner School Museum worked with them under a convenient no-rent agreement, the most recent version of which was drawn up in 1996.  In the years since, city budget cuts have taken their toll. According to Kimberly Springle, the museum\u2019s current director, the Sumner School Museum had as many as 13 employees in its heyday; today, she is the only full-time employee besides the security guards. \u201cDue to budget constraints and lack of staff,\u201d Springle said, the museum felt it could no longer accommodate not only the Friday Morning Music Club, but other groups that had regularly convened at the museum, including the Pre-Columbian Society of Washington. None, however, had quite the presence of the FMMC.  Terrified at the prospect of finding a new performance space, the club\u2019s officers invoked the old operating agreement; but the only copy they could locate was an unsigned draft, and Springle declared it null and void. The original signed copy, of course, still exists in the club\u2019s archives. Unfortunately, those archives are stored in the D.C. Historical Society, and services there have been suspended indefinitely, also due to lack of funds. The club was left with no alternative but to take its piano and find a new home. The latter proved easier than the former. The Calvary Baptist Church in Penn Quarter said it was delighted to work with the organization; the church already hosts other performing groups, including the Theatre Lab.  Taking the piano with them was the difficult part. Moving a nine-foot concert Steinway is no easy task. Getting it into the museum orginally had involved removing a window and using a crane. The club was fully prepared to reverse the process, and lined up the crane and movers for a date a few weeks ago, only to learn that the movers had not obtained the permits that might be needed in case the crane had to be used to get the piano into its new home at the church. Springle suggested an alternative: The club could simply donate the piano to the museum. But the club wasn\u2019t willing to consider the donation of an instrument worth anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000.  On Wednesday, the FMMC found a happy ending. A new piano-moving company used a special elevator jack, and the strength of nine movers, to wedge the piano into the Sumner elevator and get it out of the museum. Now the piano is installed in its new home, and the club is prepared to start its regular season there on Oct. 7.  \u201cWe\u2019re very excited about being in Penn Quarter,\u201d says Barbara Cackler, the club\u2019s program director. \u201cAnd the new venue does not have any carpeting on the floor, so the acoustics should be much better. We\u2019re looking forward to a fresh start.\u201d  midgettea@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 17:08:19", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlifestylestyleold-club-finds-new-venue-with-piano20110810giqauz5l7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 103, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Muslim women shop for modest clothing in steamy summer", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-a-steamy-summer-muslim-women-shop-for-ways-to-bare-little/2011/07/11/gIQAxghD5I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tOn the sweltering August streets of metropolitan Washington, sandals, short skirts and halter tops are seemingly de rigueur. Bare-legged women in the summer\u2019s latest chiffon miniskirts crowd the Metro platform during rush hour. Yet not all women in the area are baring their arms and legs in the heat.  The Washington area\u2019s diverse population includes Muslim women who follow the rules of Islam in their clothing choices, no matter how high temperatures soar. Many cover their arms, legs and neck in all seasons, and many cover their hair with a headscarf, or hijab.  U.S. Muslims number about 2.4 million (estimates vary), with about 250,000 in the Washington area, but no major fashion retail chain markets directly to Muslim women. As a result, many struggle to shop locally.  Bridging the gap for the \u201cmodest\u201d or \u201cIslamic\u201d market are online vendors of Muslim-style and modest clothing, offering specialized designs in swimwear, sportswear and professional clothing. Previously, such items were available only from overseas Web sites and specialty stores.  \u201cFinding the right style and material is difficult today,\u201d said Zeena Altalib of Potomac Falls, founder and head designer at PrimoModa.com, an online store and in-home boutique. Shopping for modest clothes can be challenging and frustrating, said Altalib, who started Primo Moda in 2005 to meet the needs of her friends and family.  Dan Butler, vice president for retail operations at the National Retail Federation, disagreed, saying that major retail stores offer many options for Muslim customers. \u201cDepartment stores carry long-sleeved shirts year-round, and a variety of lightweight cotton and poly fabrics,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI have seen that many off-the-rack pieces blend into Islamic wardrobes, which are often accented with traditional pieces from specialty shops and overseas.\u201d But in major retail stores, modesty is an afterthought, said Altalib, who also designs and sells swimsuits. \u201cWhen designing modest clothing, \u2018modesty\u2019 has to be the main objective during each phase of the design and manufacturing process; it has to be the guiding principle at the beginning, middle and end.\u201d Alsharifa, another online store, based in Canton, Mich., does a brisk trade in modest swimsuits and colorful tunics. Kelly Alsharif, founder and chief executive, said there is a reason Muslim women are underserved by the fashion industry. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make business sense for a major retailer to cater to a specific minority when they don\u2019t believe it would pay off across the board.\u201d  Also, the fashion industry, Hollywood and advertisers discourage retailers from bucking the trend, Alsharif said, which \u201cfocuses on sexuality to attract buyers\u2019 attention.\u201d Twenty percent of Alsharif\u2019s swimsuit buyers are not Muslim, she said. They include Christians, Jews, those who worry about sun exposure and other women who want to dress modestly. \u201cIf a chain store were to carry clothing that appealed to these groups, they would have a very loyal customer base,\u201d Alsharif said.  In the United States, most brick-and-mortar stores carrying traditional Islamic clothing are grocery stores with a tiny apparel aisle. The Khan el Khalili warehouse on Seminary Road in Falls Church has an entire floor of \u201cIslamic clothing\u201d and sells hundreds of colorful headscarves as well as modest skirts, dresses, pants and tops. Egyptian American owner Mohammed Khattab and his wife, Venetta, import shipments from Egypt every six months and follow Islamic fashion trends there, which \u201ctend to be more creative and colorful than in other Muslim countries,\u201d Khattab said. Egypt has long been an Arab-world trendsetter in music, film and fashion.  Designers and vendors of Islamic clothing agree that the right fabric makes all the difference in dressing for summer weather. \u201cOn a typical summer day, I choose a skirt and a cute tunic with a lightweight scarf that coordinates,\u201d Alsharif said. \u201cA popular staple in the Muslim lady\u2019s wardrobe right now is the maxi dress with a body shirt underneath or a lightweight cardigan over the top.\u201d  This year, Ramadan falls in the hottest season in the D.C. area, spanning August. Many Muslims won\u2019t be swimming, because they would risk breaking the dawn-to-dusk fast if water accidentally enters the mouth. Before Aug. 1, area pools seemed to be as popular with Muslim families as everyone else.  Recently at a Reston apartment complex, an Iraqi family frolicked in the pool, the mother wearing a full-body swimsuit and attached headscarf. Amana Rashid, another Reston mother, wore a burqini, a full-coverage swimsuit designed by Aheda Zanetti of Sydney. \u201cI love it,\u201d Rashid said. \u201cI can help my daughter learn how to swim. And no one has ever said anything negative about me wearing one. In fact, one person told me it was a good idea.\u201d Zanetti, 38, created the burqini in 2003. Born in Lebanon and raised in Australia, she was inspired to search for sporting garments suitable for Muslim women when she watched her niece playing netball in a traditional hijab. Zanetti said the burqini is \u201ctwo-piece like a bikini and smaller than a burqa\u201d (a traditional full-body cloak, sometimes including a face covering). The burqini and other \u201cIslamic\u201d swimsuits resemble wetsuits used for surfing or scuba diving, except they are available in various colors and styles.  Zanetti\u2019s company, Ahiida, sells a variety of modest swimwear pieces, included fitted and loose styles. Demand has been overwhelming, Zanetti said. \u201cAt first there were not enough burqini swimsuits to go around!\u201d For American Muslim women and others, \u201cthe challenge lies in our ability as women to break away from being defined and dressed by those who are pushing women to show more by wearing less,\u201d Altalib said. \u201cWomen of all ages should be liberated by choosing clothing that makes them feel secure, respected, comfortable and modest, not constantly on display for others to judge. \u201cAs a Muslim woman, I wear clothes that are flattering, yet don\u2019t show the details of my figure,\u201d Alsharif said. \u201cI do this because I believe that God has called upon Muslim women to conserve their beauty to those closest to her. So, one does not have to wear a miniskirt to look beautiful.\u201d lakea@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-09 14:23:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlifestylestylein-a-steamy-summer-muslim-women-shop-for-ways-to-bare-little20110711giqaxghd5i_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 104, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Profile of Philip Levine, poet laureate", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/profile-of-philip-levine-poet-laureate/2011/08/08/gIQAg6xf5I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tPhilip Levine was not expecting to be the new poet laureate of the United States. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t something I thought I\u2019d get,\u201d he said, sounding a little amused by the whole thing.  Levine, who has written 20 collections of poems, has already won just about every major writing award: a Pulitzer Prize in 1995 for \u201cThe Simple Truth,\u201d a National Book Award in 1980 for \u201cAshes: Poems New and Old\u201d and in 1991 for \u201cWhat Work Is,\u201d the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize, the Frank O\u2019Hara Prize, two Guggenheim Foundation fellowships .\u2009.\u2009. the list goes on.  \u201cHe could\u2019ve been poet laureate 20 years ago,\u201d said Robert Casper, head of the Poetry and Literature Center at the Library of Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s the most visible and widest reaching position in American poetry, and arguably one of the most visible and widest reaching positions in American letters.\u201d  The poet laureate is selected by the librarian of Congress to serve a one-year term. His or her only defined responsibilities are to open the literary season in October and close it in May with a reading, but many poets laureate elect to organize poetry projects to increase awareness of the art across the country. The laureate, said Casper, is \u201cbringing poetry to ordinary Americans and showing how it\u2019s valuable and even essential to their lives.\u201d Like most great triumphs, Levine\u2019s achievement has a simple beginning.  It was the early 1940s and 13-year-old Levine was living by the outskirts of Detroit, about a mile from 8 Mile Road. That was back when the city really ended at its borders; Levine remembers there were five or so houses in an area of six city blocks and, beyond that, emptiness. After dinner, he went out into the groves of trees. He would stand in the dirt, in the dusk, in the dark, and compose poetry in his head. He\u2019d always had a fantastic memory, so it was no trouble to recite and revise his words on the spot. It became a weekly ritual. \u201cWhat I found was a voice within myself that I didn\u2019t know was there,\u201d said Levine, now 83. \u201cA joy in my being, in creation, in the physical world that surrounded me. \u201cIt began with a love of just the language. There was nothing that I had ever read that moved me as powerfully as some of the poetry I read. .\u2009.\u2009. Poems were something I could memorize and carry with me, and recite them in my head, and live with them. \u201c Levine later labored at industrial gigs in automobile manufacturing plants, such as Detroit Transmission and the Chevrolet Gear and Axle factory, while continuing to write poems in his off hours. His poetry taps into memories of his time on an assembly line, a sort of transcript of a life spent hard at work. He went on to college at Wayne State University and earned an MFA from the Iowa Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1953. Levine has also written several antiwar nonfiction books. He taught at California State University, Fresno, and remains a professor emeritus in the English Department.  When Levine was 17, his English teacher lent him a book of Wilfred Owen\u2019s poetry. Levine, coming of age during WWII, immersed himself in this \u201cexquisitely antiwar book\u201d based on Owen\u2019s experiences as a lieutenant in WWI.  \u201cIt validated my own feelings about a future in combat,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not look forward to graduating high school and getting drafted. .\u2009.\u2009. If you went to the films, which we did all the time, it was very clear that you were less than a man if you weren\u2019t willing to go out there and get blown apart in battle. And I didn\u2019t really want to kill anybody either. .\u2009.\u2009. That was my first powerful attraction to great poetry.\u201d  Levine lucked out; he graduated from high school in 1946, after the war was over. By the time he was 26, Levine had this visceral certainty: He could be a poet. \u201cI had immense confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the [expletive] it came from. I knew I could do this thing. I didn\u2019t know what the [expletive] it would be or where it would go. But I knew I was going to write poetry and I knew that I was going to stick with it.\u201d James Billington, the librarian of Congress, selected Levine as the poet laureate (while he takes the opinions of others into consideration, it ultimately falls to the librarian to make the choice). He said of Levine\u2019s work, \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous to see parts of automobiles and other things in Detroit turned into a story that is partly mythological in its suggestion but based on very ordinary things that we all use and depend on.\u201d \u201cHe elevates the experience of working people into something that is able to impart a little wisdom to us.\u201d \u201cHis poems .\u2009.\u2009. are accessible but not simple,\u201d said Casper. \u201cThey speak to the struggles and the mysteries of our lives.\u201d True to the down-to-earth nature of his poetry, Levine doesn\u2019t have grand ambitions for his service as poet laureate. \u201cI want the best poetry to be read and appreciated, that\u2019s all. .\u2009.\u2009. You can be a magnificent person and be profound and super and really an ideal kind of man or woman and not give two [expletive] for poetry.\u201d You can be, that is, but he is not. Poetry, he said, \u201cis almost a religion to me.\u201d goldsteinj@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-09 19:43:28", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlifestylestyleprofile-of-philip-levine-poet-laureate20110808giqag6xf5i_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 226, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:30:10", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:10", "headline": "Featured Advertiser", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/b69a22a4eba9769775d29a4e261f554a", "content": "<a href=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/click.phdo?s=b69a22a4eba9769775d29a4e261f554a&amp;p=4\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/img.phdo?s=b69a22a4eba9769775d29a4e261f554a&amp;p=4\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-12 03:00:00", "guid": "false", "slug": "httpfeedswashingtonpostcomrssb69a22a4eba9769775d29a4e261f554a"}}, {"pk": 228, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:31:45", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:10", "headline": "Judge says Ohio killer of 11 deserves death penalty, formal sentencing due later", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-facing-decision-for-ohio-killer-of-11-death-or-life-in-prison-without-chance-of-parole/2011/08/12/gIQALpoVAJ_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tCLEVELAND \u2014 A serial killer deserves the death penalty for murdering 11 women and dumping their bodies around his property, a judge said Friday.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJudge Dick Ambrose announced the decision after a 45-minute analysis of Anthony Sowell\u2019s crimes and background factors in Sowell\u2019s favor. Formal sentencing was to follow a series of statements from the relatives of victims.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSowell slumped back in his chair without emotion as the judge announced his decision.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDozens of relatives were in the courtroom. As the sentencing hearing began, deputies passed around boxes of tissues to the relatives and warned against any outburst. Those asking to address the court included the daughter of one victim and a woman whose niece was killed by Sowell.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourt administrator Greg Popovich said that with a number of people expected to make statements, the hearing could run up to three hours.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSowell was seated in court wearing an orange jail jumpsuit, his hands cuffed with waist chains. He was arrested on Halloween 2009, two days after police went to his house on a sexual-assault complaint and began finding bodies.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe went on trial in June and was convicted July 22 on 82 counts: aggravated murder, kidnapping, corpse abuse and evidence tampering.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAssistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Pinky Carr has said the case \u201cscreamed death penalty.\u201d Her prosecution colleague, Richard Bombik, said \u201cif this guy doesn\u2019t get the death penalty, nobody should.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSowell\u2019s defense team, John Parker and Rufus Sims, rested without calling witnesses and instead focused on sparing his life with sympathetic testimony about his troubled childhood, his Marine Corps service and good behavior while serving 15 years for attempted rape.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe women began disappearing in 2007, and prosecutors say Sowell lured them to his home with the promise of alcohol or drugs. Police discovered the first two bodies and a freshly dug grave in late 2009 after officers went to investigate a woman\u2019s report that she had been raped there.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMany of the slain women had been missing for weeks or months, and some had criminal records. They were disposed of in garbage bags and plastic sheets, then dumped in various parts of the house and yard. There was little left of one victim: a skull in a plastic bucket with non-human bite marks on the edge.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe rotting bodies created an overpowering stench that neighbors blamed on an adjacent sausage factory. The owner spent $20,000 on new plumbing fixtures and sewer lines, to no avail.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMost of the victims were nude from the waist down, strangled with household objects and had traces of cocaine or depressants in their systems. All the victims were black, as is Sowell.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJurors sat through weeks of disturbing and emotional testimony before convicting Sowell. They saw photographs of the victims\u2019 blackened, skeletal corpses lying on autopsy tables and listened to police describe how their bodies had been left to rot in Sowell\u2019s Cleveland home and backyard.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSowell took the stand Monday to make an unsworn statement in which he apologized.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cThe only thing I want to say is I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sowell told the jury. \u201cI know that might not sound like much, but I truly am sorry from the bottom of my heart.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe jury didn\u2019t buy it: They said his statement, which was guided by questions from Parker, sounded rehearsed and lacked remorse.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSowell wasn\u2019t subject to cross-examination, so prosecutors didn\u2019t get to ask why he killed the women and lived in the house for two years with their remains bagged in corners or buried in the backyard.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSowell mostly sat impassively during the trial but smiled at childhood recollections by a half-brother and a greeting from his stepmother\u2019s 88-year-old mother, who looked up from the witness stand and seemed surprised to see him.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCopyright 2011 The Associated Press.

It was written by Dennis, MacGillis and Montgomery. In mid-January, newly installed as the GOP House majority leader, Virginia\u2019s Eric Cantor rose to the podium inside a spacious hotel ballroom to deliver a message to his troops, including the 87 newcomers who had given the party control of the House. A vote to increase the nation\u2019s $14.3 trillion debt limit was coming soon, he told the caucus members who had gathered at the Marriott in Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor for a closed-door retreat less than 10 days after taking power. Think of it as a \u201chidden\u201d opportunity, he implored them, a chance to achieve their goal of reining in the federal government and its spending habits. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to look at a potential increase in the debt limit as a leverage moment when the White House and President Obama will have to deal with us,\u201d said Cantor, one of several new House leaders who detailed the game plan for the coming months. \u201cEither we stick together and demonstrate that we\u2019re a team that will fight for and stand by our principles, or we will lose that leverage.\u201d The frantic showdown that followed, bringing the nation to the brink of default, looked like the haphazard escalation of a typical partisan standoff. It wasn\u2019t. It was the natural outgrowth of a years-long effort by GOP recruiters to build a new majority and reverse the party\u2019s fortunes. That effort began before the economy collapsed in 2008, before the government bailouts that followed, before the tea party rose in response to push its anti-tax, anti-spending message. With the backing of the GOP establishment, Cantor and two colleagues banded together as the \u201cYoung Guns,\u201d drawing their nickname from a magazine feature anointing them rising stars. They scoured the country for like-minded conservatives who shared their uncompromising commitment to shrinking the federal government. They showered these Young Gun recruits with money and support and exhorted them to maintain a laser-like fiscal focus. By early 2010, talk of the \u201cdebt ceiling\u201d began to creep into the lexicon of some Young Gun candidates, first as a reaction to Congress yet again giving the nation the authority to borrow more money. But in time, it became a shorthand, their synonym for all that was wrong with Washington. How the shorthand of 2010 grew into the showdown of 2011 is the story of a Republican resurgence that brought immense advantage to the leadership but also created immense expectations among this new breed of lawmaker. Having built a majority on ideology, the GOP leadership found itself struggling to control a rambunctious rank and file determined to live up to the bold rhetoric that had brought it to Washington. The newcomers took Cantor seriously when he urged them in January to see the debt ceiling as leverage. Democrats called the GOP irresponsible for gambling with the economy and the nation\u2019s flawless credit. Republicans countered that an epic clash over the debt limit was inevitable, given the outcome of the election and widespread anger with runaway government spending. When the deal was finally done and the threat of an economy-rattling default averted, the newcomers\u2019 disdain for compromise had proved effective. They got most of what they wanted and gave little ground. The new majority emerged emboldened \u2014 and hankering for the confrontations to come \u2014 even as the financial markets and much of the country reacted with unease about what had just happened. This account of the party\u2019s transformation, and its impact on the nation\u2019s economic course, is drawn from interviews with the leading participants during this summer\u2019s drama and from earlier interviews, some of them recorded, at various points during the past 21/2 years.  Chapter 1: Inauguration blues In January 2009, on a night aglow with inaugural balls and Democrats celebrating their newly-elected president, a gathering of Republican lawmakers picked at their dinners in the Caucus Room restaurant off Pennsylvania Avenue. They felt anything but cheerful. The original Young Guns \u2014 Cantor, Kevin McCarthy of California and Paul Ryan of Wisconsin \u2014 were there, along with disconsolate colleagues from the House and Senate. The evening started as \u201cjust another conservative bitch session,\u201d Ryan later recalled. \u201cIt was basically, \u2018What just happened?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Excuses mingled with a search for explanations. Some around the table argued that Republicans had simply fallen victim to the crumbling economy. Others suggested that their presidential nominee, John McCain, simply hadn\u2019t stirred enough enthusiasm among voters. No, said Ryan and others. The problem was deeper. A \u201cfundamental rot\u201d had set in, as party leaders had adopted bloated budgets, chased pork-barrel spending and worried too much about getting reelected. The American people had sent a punishing message. Voters hadn\u2019t just chosen Democrats. They had deserted Republicans. As the evening wore on, the melancholy gave way to strategizing about how to right the ship. A return to power required a return to the party\u2019s core values, the group agreed. To change their fortunes at the polls, they had to change direction. Cantor, McCarthy and Ryan had already set out to recruit Young Gun candidates who shared their vision. Smaller government and lower taxes, not explosive federal spending, would be their route to growth and prosperity. Despite the GOP\u2019s crushing defeat at the polls in 2008, some of their recruits had won. They vowed to redouble their efforts. By the time dinner ended, the mood had improved. \u201cI thought, these guys have finally woken up,\u201d said McCarthy, the man who would take a primary role in the coming recruiting blitz. \u201cThey\u2019re not gonna sit back. They weren\u2019t afraid to compete on policy .\u2009.\u2009. It was a turning point.\u201d Chapter 2: Diamonds in the rough By December 2009, McCarthy\u2019s expectations had brightened dramatically. \u201cI can feel the ground moving and changing,\u201d he told a Washington Post reporter who had come to see him at the Capitol Hill offices of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the NRCC. McCarthy rifled through a massive binder, amassed over months of cross-country travel in his role as the GOP\u2019s chief recruiter. A former small-business owner with a head of silver hair and a gleaming smile, he knew what he was looking for: That diamond in the rough with the charisma to raise piles of cash and the passion to inspire voters with a vision of limited government. McCarthy would leave his suits in Washington, slipping on Levis for countless cups of coffee in countless small-town diners. He had a mathematician\u2019s faith in numbers, charting census data and studying how a rival strategist, Rahm Emanuel, had built the Democratic majority in 2006. He enrolled many of his finds in the Young Guns program backed by the NRCC. As the candidates proved their mettle, they moved up the ladder: from \u201con the radar\u201d to \u201ccontender\u201d to \u201cYoung Gun.\u201d Each step came with more support from the party and various political action committees that McCarthy and the other Young Guns maintained. The names spilled out as he took the Post reporter on a state-by-state preview of the GOP lineup: \u201cYou know Sean Duffy? .\u2009.\u2009. a district attorney, a world-class lumberjack.\u201d \u201cAdam Kinzinger .\u2009.\u2009. Good guy, good, aggressive guy.\u201d \u201cThis Steve Stivers, he\u2019s a rock star.\u201d All would make it to Washington, joining the freshman class of 2011. McCarthy\u2019s travels had also alerted him to the gathering steam of the tea party. He saw a potential ally, not a threat. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit back and think we have all the right ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be able to come up with an agenda that will unite everyone. I think we have the principles that do that from this idea of fiscal responsibility.\u201d Polls were showing a growing dislike for the Democrats. But he knew that didn\u2019t necessarily translate into love for the Republicans. Still, there was time. McCarthy could sense a majority within reach. \u201cIf we\u2019re a stock, [voters] are buying at the bottom,\u201d he predicted. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make money on us.\u201d Chapter 3: Catching the wave In early 2010, McCarthy\u2019s faith in a Republican resurgence was bolstered by hard electoral evidence. Scott Brown won Edward M. Kennedy\u2019s Senate seat in Massachusetts. Around the country, a new catchphrase appeared in the rhetoric of some Young Gun recruits, prompted by a nearly routine action in Washington. On Feb. 4, Congress voted to increase the nation\u2019s borrowing limit \u2014 a vote it had taken 40 times in the past three decades \u2014 and a little-known city councilwoman in Montgomery, Ala., issued a statement. \u201cThis \u2018need\u2019 to raise the debt ceiling is caused by one thing: out-of-control spending in Washington,\u201d said Martha Roby, a Young Gun recruit whose campaign was ramping up. That same day, a roofing contractor and Young Gun candidate in Wisconsin named Reid Ribble released his own statement attacking the Democratic incumbent for voting to boost the debt ceiling. \u201cThis Congress has done nothing but spend future generations of this country into a black hole,\u201d his statement said. By summer, \u201cdebt limit\u201d had joined runaway spending as a sound bite. In South Dakota, GOP challenger Kristi Noem used the phrase to hammer her Democratic opponent, Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin. Noem told Fox News that Sandlin had \u201cvoted for the budgets that have put this country further into debt. She voted to raise our country\u2019s federal debt ceiling as well.\u201d The Fox newscaster, Neil Cavuto, challenged her. \u201cYes, but a lot people voted to raise the debt ceiling, because the government would shut down without it, right?\u201d \u201cWell, a lot of people did,\u201d Noem said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make it right.\u201d In September, with the election two months off and the Republican Party pushing hard in every corner of the country, Cantor, McCarthy and Ryan published a book called \u201cThe Young Guns,\u201d appearing on television together and releasing a slick one-minute video that looked like a campaign ad. \u201cA new team is ready to bring America back,\u201d the video proclaimed. The book plugged some of their favorite Young Gun candidates, including Roby. She won. So did Noem and Ribble, helping the Republicans win 242 seats and capture the House by a historic margin. Rep. John Boehner (Ohio), the incoming House speaker who also had worked hard on behalf of many candidates, quickly grasped the potential dilemma posed by 87 newcomers with steep expectations. The House was now stocked with people who had little interest in rubber-stamping another debt-limit increase. \u201cI\u2019ve made it pretty clear to them that as we get into next year, it\u2019s pretty clear that Congress is going to have to deal with\u201d the debt limit, Boehner told reporters on Nov. 19. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to deal with it as adults. Whether we like it or not, the federal government has obligations, and we have obligations on our part.\u201d Chapter 4: Rebels with a cause That wasn\u2019t what some new members wanted to hear. Soon after his election, freshman Tim Scott of South Carolina raised the issue on a nationally-syndicated Christian radio show. \u201cAre we going to continue to raise the debt ceiling and sell an illusion to the American people? My answer is no,\u201d said Scott, who had just been chosen as one of two liaisons between the leadership and the freshman class. Outside groups fueled the fire. At an orientation hosted by the tea party-affiliated group FreedomWorks, former congressman Dick Armey, a co-author of the 1994 Contract With America, exhorted dozens of freshmen with words promoting rebellion rather than allegiance: \u201cYou don\u2019t owe your office to the majority. You owe your office to the people who put you there.\u201d The freshmen also heard from GOP pollster Frank Luntz, who offered numbers showing that a majority of Americans did not want the debt limit raised. That sparked lengthy discussions, according to several of those in attendance. The freshmen \u201cleft basically saying that if they were going to raise it, \u2018We absolutely have to get something in return,\u2019\u00a0\u201d FreedomWorks spokesman Adam Brandon recalled. About that time, Rep. Jason Chaffetz went to Cantor\u2019s office to chat. Chaffetz, a Utah sophomore, had developed a close bond with Cantor and McCarthy. Chaffetz asked Cantor: Now that we control the House, how do we use our power? Cantor didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cHe said, \u2018One of the biggest things that\u2019s going to happen is that we have to deal with the debt ceiling,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Chaffetz recalled in a recent interview. \u201cHe, in particular, knew a long time ago that that was going to be a big deal.\u201d That was a sharper message than Boehner\u2019s, and it had come from his number two. Chapter 5: Warnings Others in official Washington had not yet grasped quite how big a deal the debt limit could become. The White House, though, had an inkling. Obama and his advisers had picked up on the debt-limit fervor. They say they took a run at increasing the debt ceiling as part of a tax package that passed Congress in December, but got no traction. Asked recently about what happened, they reacted with some irritation. \u201cThere was no market for doing the debt limit in December,\u201d said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was describing internal discussions. \u201cNeither the Democrats or Republicans were ready to deal with it. .\u2009.\u2009. You can\u2019t force action.\u201d At a Dec. 7 news conference to announce the tax deal, which included an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, a reporter asked Obama why the debt limit hadn\u2019t been addressed. It would seem, the reporter said, that the Republicans will \u201chave a significant amount of leverage over the White House now.\u201d Obama responded, \u201cWhen you say significant leverage .\u2009.\u2009. what do you mean?\u201d The reporter said the GOP might refuse to raise the debt ceiling unless Obama signed off on spending cuts \u201cthat probably go deeper and further than you\u2019re willing to do.\u201d Obama directed his answer at the GOP leadership. \u201cLook, here\u2019s my expectation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take John Boehner at his word \u2014 that nobody, Democrat or Republican, is willing to see the full faith and credit of the United States government collapse. .\u2009.\u2009. Once John Boehner is sworn in as speaker, then he\u2019s going to have responsibilities to govern. You can\u2019t just stand on the sidelines and be a bomb thrower.\u201d But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be Boehner throwing the bombs. Chapter 6: \u2018Surprises are for birthdays\u2019 A month later, Cantor delivered his \u201cleverage moment\u201d speech at the new Republican House majority\u2019s retreat, held at a hotel in downtown Baltimore. The debt-limit vote might be their best shot, but it wouldn\u2019t be their only one. Cantor told caucus members that they would get three bites at the government-spending apple: First, the extension of a temporary resolution to keep the government running through fiscal 2011. Second, a budget blueprint for fiscal 2012. And third, the debt-limit increase. That first bite, however, left many newcomers with a bitter taste and a skepticism of their leadership\u2019s willingness to stand firm. During the campaign, GOP leaders had vowed to cut $100\u00a0billion from the 2011 budget. They began backpedaling on that pledge almost immediately after taking office. The target dwindled from $100\u00a0billion to $60\u00a0billion to $30\u00a0billion, for complicated reasons that House leaders found difficult to explain and the freshmen found hard to understand. One hour before a midnight shutdown of federal agencies was set to occur, congressional leaders settled on a $38\u00a0billion cut \u2014 an unprecedented sum, but far short of what the freshmen had been promised. Then, just before the House vote, the freshmen were handed another disappointment: Budget analysts reported that the plan would reduce actual spending in the current year by only $350\u00a0million. The measure passed, but 59 House Republicans defected, including 27 freshmen. Allen West, a frustrated tea party freshman from Florida, derided the 2011 budget cuts as \u201ca raindrop in the ocean\u201d and said House leaders needed to have a \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d moment. \u201cI like people to be upfront with me. Surprises are for birthdays,\u201d West told reporters. In the midst of that battle, Ryan rolled out his 2012 budget blueprint, in part to revive his party\u2019s flagging spirits. As chairman of the House Budget committee, Ryan had a high-profile platform to pursue the Young Gun agenda. Republicans enthusiastically embraced his plan to privatize Medicare for future retirees, slash spending on Medicaid and sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and the wealthy. Still, the success of the Ryan budget in the House (it never passed the Senate) couldn\u2019t fully erase the bad taste of the first bite of the budget apple. South Carolina\u2019s Scott called the battle over the 2011 budget a \u201cdefining moment\u201d for the newcomers. \u201cIt strengthened our resolve to stick together,\u201d he said, \u201cnot necessarily against anyone, but for the people back home.\u2019\u2019 Others felt the leadership built up expectations even more by suggesting that the real battle lay ahead. Rep. Mike Coffman, a freshman from Colorado, said the message from Boehner and Cantor was clear. \u201cThey were saying, \u2018This is really not the place to take a stand. We\u2019re going to have a lot more leverage with the debt ceiling.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Chapter 7: \u2018Hold the freaking line\u2019 At town halls back home, many GOP legislators encountered constituents who beseeched them to refuse an increase in the debt ceiling outright, or else not to vote for an increase without massive spending cuts. Meanwhile, in the lightning-fast feedback loop of the Internet, a host of outside influences kept reminding the freshmen that their words and actions were being watched. FreedomWorks and other tea party groups warned Republicans to stick to their fiscal promises. FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe, declared, \u201cThere will be serious consequences at the ballot box for Republicans blinking on this issue.\u201d The Tea Party Patriots encouraged organizers in districts across the country to keep up the pressure on their representatives. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep watching them,\u201d the group\u2019s co-founder, Jenny Beth Martin, said as she wrapped up a hot afternoon of meetings on Capitol Hill. \u201cQuite a few of them are blindly trusting the leadership, and that\u2019s very disappointing.\u201d Martin warned that her group would recruit candidates to challenge any GOP lawmakers who wavered on the debt limit. Her threat revolved around a new verb that had begun to crop up in tea party circles. \u201cI think we are going to see people who are \u2018primaried\u2019 next year,\u201d she said. Erick Erickson, editor of RedState.com, a conservative blog with a large following, attacked the House leadership\u2019s apparent willingness to compromise. He implored rank-and-file conservatives to stand strong. \u201cFear has no business entering into your negotiations,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is no fallback. There is no alternative. Hold the freaking line.\u201d A similar message also came, in a quieter way, from the trade groups for the nation\u2019s hedge funds and private equity firms. Their members had billions at stake, thanks to a White House proposal that would raise some tax revenue at their expense. As the July home stretch arrived, they had already spent $4.2 million on lobbying expenses for the year. Chapter 8: Behind closed doors At the White House, uncertainty colored the administration\u2019s negotiating strategy. In private, Boehner acted as the same old negotiator he\u2019d always been. But once he left the room to sell something to the firebrands in his party, he couldn\u2019t seal the deal. Twice during the battle over the 2011 budget, White House officials believed both sides had settled on a figure for spending cuts. Twice, they said, Boehner backed away after consulting with his caucus. Still, Obama and his advisers believed Boehner and his troops might prove more flexible in talks aimed at meeting their demand for spending cuts to accompany the debt limit increase. Dramatic changes to Medicare proposed in the Ryan budget had sparked a public outcry. Democrats believed that Republicans would be eager to hide that stain by striking an agreement with Democrats to cut the program less sharply. The political downside: It would leave Democrats unable to use Medicare as an issue against Republicans in the 2012 campaign. Obama, Vice President Biden and other White House officials firmly believed that it would be easier to sell a big deal, if it actually stabilized the debt, than trying to persuade lawmakers to vote for cuts that were both politically painful and too modest to solve the problem. \u201cDon\u2019t die on a small cross,\u201d Biden was fond of saying. By the time Obama teamed up with Boehner for a round of golf in mid-June, many in the administration believed that a bipartisan grand bargain that raised tax revenue and took a swing at Medicare costs could happen. But when talk turned to new tax revenue, the Republicans kept shutting down. In June, Cantor walked away from talks led by Biden after Democrats pressed him to accept a plan that limited some tax breaks for corporations and wealthier Americans in exchange for cuts to federal health programs. Cantor said it was up to Boehner to make such decisions. Boehner, meanwhile, engaged Obama in secret talks over a grand bargain. But he, too, walked away as Cantor argued that they couldn\u2019t get the caucus to accept any tax hike. \u201cThere was always a sense that Cantor had his finger on the pulse of the tea party crowd,\u201d a Democratic official involved in the talks said. Cantor and Boehner both emphasized that the new hard-liners were a \u201cdifferent breed,\u201d an \u201cextreme force that could not be controlled.\u201d The official added: \u201cI, for one, was never sure whether they were using this as a negotiating tactic or expressing genuine frustration.\u201d Boehner\u2019s office acknowledged the newcomers\u2019 effect on the negotiations. Asked about the leader\u2019s tactics after the deal was made, spokesman Michael Steel said the early focus on the debt limit was dictated by the attitudes of the new majority. The leadership drove a hard bargain out of necessity, he said, knowing that anything less wouldn\u2019t stand a chance of passing the House. \u201cWe could see this fight was coming, because we had a new group of people who weren\u2019t interested in the way Washington has always done business,\u201d Steel said. \u201cIf they were going to vote for a debt-limit increase, they were going to need serious spending cuts and real reforms.\u201d Chapter 9: Doubts and suspicions As the Aug. 2 default date drew closer with no deal in sight, GOP leaders intensified their campaign to convince the holdouts that the \u201cadult moment\u201d Boehner warned of last fall had arrived. The leadership arranged for numerous experts from rating agencies and think tanks to brief the caucus on the likely consequences of default. One presentation, a slide show by a former Treasury official who served under President George H.W. Bush, soberly detailed the daunting choices that the government would face if it ran short of cash. Some members were convinced. Others, including South Carolina\u2019s Scott, were unmoved. Scott said he understood that breaching the deadline could inflict short-term pain. But without serious cuts, he said, \u201cthere won\u2019t be a long term.\u201d The leadership, having made the debt limit into a rallying cry, was trying to make sure that the newcomers didn\u2019t push too far. \u201cLeaders like me would try to tell them: Look, no, really, we think it could be bad,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThey\u2019d look at it with suspicion .\u2009.\u2009. If there was any semi-credible source saying default wouldn\u2019t be so bad, they clung to that.\u201d Still, Ryan sympathized with their ardor and desire for change. \u201cI was like that when I first got to Congress,\u201d he said, recalling his time as an angry back-bencher, throwing procedural monkey wrenches into the gears of the House. Ryan told the newcomers that he learned to work within the system without sacrificing his principles, and he tried to persuade them that they could do the same. He counseled them to be patient, to accept partial victory. \u201cYou have to get a mandate from the country that\u2019s big enough\u201d \u2014 control of House, Senate, White House \u2014 \u201cto do what we want to do,\u201d he recalled telling them. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that kind of mandate right now.\u201d Chapter 10: Burning down the house In mid-July, Boehner tried again for a big deal. On Friday, July 15, as Capitol Hill began emptying out for the coming weekend, he invited White House chief of staff William Daley and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to his office. With Cantor in the room, Boehner laid out an ambitious plan to tame the debt that would include a rewrite of the tax code that would raise an additional $800\u00a0billion over 10 years \u2014 the equivalent of letting the Bush tax cuts expire for the nation\u2019s top earners, a key Democratic demand. If White House officials had any skepticism that Boehner could deliver, they felt they had little choice but to engage him. The deal was big and bold, and White House officials believed it was worth going the extra mile to see whether it would work. On Thursday, July 21, Obama\u2019s senior advisers met at the White House with top aides to Boehner and Cantor. For two hours, they went line by line through the emerging agreement. It felt like they were \u201cvery close\u201d to the promised land, a senior administration official said. That afternoon, Obama called Boehner and gave him a choice: If you want aggressive entitlement cuts, I need more revenue. But if you can\u2019t stomach extra revenue, we can dial back the entitlement cuts and still do something important. The call went well, according to Democrats in the room. That evening, Obama met with Democratic leaders and told them to prepare for tough cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. Twenty-four hours later, the deal was dead. Once again, Boehner walked away. Worse, from the administration\u2019s point of view, Boehner\u2019s rhetoric was growing harsher, at times echoing the most uncompromising voices in his new majority. Administration officials now faced what they saw as a frightening possibility: That the controlling party in the House might be willing to \u201clet the house burn down,\u201d in the phrase bandied about at the White House \u2014 unless its demands were met. Obama\u2019s top advisers, surveying their options, decided to open some doors to compromising on their tax demands. In their view, with flames licking the rafters, House Republicans were not just slamming doors shut. They were locking them. Epilogue In the end, the White House backed off its demand for new tax revenue and agreed to a multi-phase deal that may produce only spending cuts. In return, Congress gave the Treasury sufficient borrowing power to pay the government\u2019s bills through the 2012 election. On the Hill, leaders congratulated themselves for averting disaster. Republicans considered it a win-win: deep spending cuts to come and no new taxes. But the markets were less impressed with the turn toward austerity. After slumping for days, they swooned Thursday amid mounting fears of a new global slowdown. On Friday, the rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s issued the first-ever downgrade of the nation\u2019s credit rating, saying the \u201cpolitical brinkmanship of recent months\u201d had shown evidence of \u201cAmerica\u2019s governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable.\u201d The public shared the markets\u2019 unhappiness. In a New York Times poll released Thursday, 82\u00a0percent of those surveyed said they disapproved of how Congress was doing its job, a record number. Republicans earned more criticism than Democrats. For Democrats, the deal\u2019s lack of new tax revenue was hard to swallow. But some believed they would be able to regain leverage this fall, when a new committee begins working to tame the debt, and late next year, when the Bush-era tax cuts are set once again to expire. For Republican leaders, there was pride in a hand well played. \u201cI think some of our members may have thought the default issue was a hostage you might take a chance at shooting,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said. \u201cMost of us didn\u2019t think that. What we did learn is this \u2014 it\u2019s a hostage that\u2019s worth ransoming.\u201d McCarthy was more plain-spoken. \u201cWould Democrats have ever agreed if they thought the new freshman class was going to roll over? No. The freshmen made our hand so much stronger,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cYou had a fear of how far they would go. I\u2019m sure the president looks back, too, and was fearful. But in negotiations, isn\u2019t that the best thing?\u201d Chaffetz, who voted against both Boehner\u2019s first proposal and the final bill, said he was well aware of how the leadership had used his and others\u2019 willingness to let a default happen as a negotiating chip, and said he didn\u2019t mind at all. \u201cWe weren\u2019t kidding around, either,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have taken it down.\u201d For the freshman class, most of whom ultimately voted for the final deal, there was ambivalence about this bite of the spending apple. The cuts should have been deeper, many said, and the deal should have included a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Still, it recognized how far it had shifted the debate. Rep. Tom Graves of Georgia, who arrived last year with strong support from tea party groups and Cantor\u2019s PAC, voted no on the deal. Hours later, he changed into faded jeans to attend a $1,500-per-head fundraiser on his behalf, held at the AT&T box at Nationals Park, a classic Washington-style event. The next day, he was flying home for a corn roast in his district and looking forward to explaining his vote to his constituents. \u201cUnfortunately, it was a compromise,\u201d he said of the deal. \u201cCompromises led us into this mess, and you can\u2019t compromise your way out of it.\u201d The House leadership, meanwhile, has already started to focus on maintaining its majority. Cantor and McCarthy, through their PACs, have together bestowed nearly $440,000 in early contributions to fellow conservatives, according to campaign financing reports. Freshmen have received most of their largess: Of a combined 69 contributions made, 52 have gone to newcomers. Boehner\u2019s PAC hasn\u2019t made as many donations, contributing $170,000 to 20 of the freshmen, and 23 candidates overall, the reports show. In July, the NRCC re-launched its Young Guns program for 2012. More than a dozen candidates have qualified as \u201con the radar,\u201d the first step toward increased fundraising support. McCarthy isn\u2019t spearheading the recruiting effort this time around, but he hasn\u2019t abandoned the search for diamonds in the rough. The ink on the debt deal was barely dry when he made plans to visit a potential candidate in Arkansas. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more to go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for the long term. We\u2019re always going to be striving for more.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-06 17:28:18", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcombusinesseconomyorigins-of-the-debt-showdown20110803giqa9uqizi_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 107, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "\u2018Watch the Throne\u2019 by Jay-Z and Kanye West", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/watch-the-throne-by-jay-z-and-kanye-west/2011/08/08/gIQAvs5J3I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tIn Sunday\u2019s fading minutes, hip-hop America huddled around the digital watercooler for the exclusive iTunes release of \u201cWatch the Throne,\u201d a galactically hyped collaboration that Jay-Z and Kanye West somehow kept from leaking to the masses. The clock struck midnight like a starter pistol. As fans raced toward an opinion, Twitter didn\u2019t sleep. \u201cWatch the Throne\u201d was a bitter disappointment! An instant classic! A bitter disappointment, but only if you were expecting an instant classic \u2014 otherwise, pretty good! But flowing beneath that miasma of reflexive haterade and compulsory adulation was a triumphal subtext. Two superstar rappers had everyone in a splintered popscape talking about the same thing. At once. We were experiencing The Great Galvanizing Pop Music Moment of 2011. Hip-hop hooray? Now, just a few smoke-clearing hours later, \u201cWatch the Throne\u201d feels like a much more meaningful triumph. It\u2019s a compelling, complex, conflicted album so densely layered with commentary on race and class that the idea of trying to parse it in 140 characters at 3\u00a0o\u2019clock in the morning seems ridiculous. It\u2019s also a relief. Those expecting a disastrous ego clash will have to wait for Congress to reconvene \u2014 or until Jay-Z and West hit the road together this fall. Here, the duo volley between the contemplative and the petulant, dreaming contorted American dreams in which your worth is defined by your Rolex, your tenacity, your Warhol collection, your desire, the cars in your garage and the chips on your shoulder. Over the course of 16 tracks, rebellion is consistently tempered with gluttony \u2014 the two dissonant spirits that make this country great. Well, at least they make this album great, especially on \u201cMurder to Excellence,\u201d a song split into two dizzying halves. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to stop and redefine black power,\u201d West declares in the first half. He compares urban murder rates to Iraq war casualties, even genocide, over the warble of a guitar that sounds as if it\u2019s been beaten out of tune. In part two, Jay finds solace in wealth and prestige. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of black excellence,\u201d he raps. \u201cOpulence, decadence, tuxes next to the president.\u201d Even the sparkling beat of \u201cIllest [Expletive] Alive\u201d feels opulent as Jay brags about the Basquiats hanging in his bathroom: \u201cUsually you have this much taste, you European\u00a0/ That\u2019s the end of that way of thinking.\u201d He brings a similar notion to the halls of the Museum of Modern Art with \u201cThat\u2019s My [Expletive],\u201d challenging art-world beauty standards: \u201cIf Picasso was alive he would have made her. .\u2009.\u2009. Mona Lisa can\u2019t fade her\u00a0/ I mean, Marilyn Monroe, she is quite nice\u00a0/ But why all the pretty icons always all white?\u00a0/ Put some colored girls in the MoMa.\u201d West, meantime, is at his most engrossing with \u201cNew Day,\u201d as he and Jay deliver preemptive apologies to the unborn glimmers in their eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll never let my son have an ego,\u201d West rhymes. \u201cHe\u2019ll be nice to everyone wherever we go\u00a0/ I mean, I might even make him be Republican\u00a0/ So everybody know he love white people.\u201d His defiance quickly withers into self-pity: \u201cI just want him to have a easy life\u00a0/ Not like Yeezy life\u00a0/ Just want him to be someone people like.\u201d As West slumps into a forlorn headspace that Jay is typically allergic to, a twinkling keyboard ushers in a tender second verse. \u201cSorry, junior\u00a0/ I already ruined ya\u2019,\u201d Jay raps. \u201cYou ain\u2019t even alive\u00a0/ paparazzi pursuing ya.\u2019\u2009\u201d The other tracks here \u2014 West co-produced a dozen of them \u2014 wouldn\u2019t sound out of place on West\u2019s masterly 2010 album \u201cMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\u201d Nothing jumps out as a single, but each track provides the reliable sonic bedrock required for a balancing act of this nature. But where the sound is coherent, the worldviews diverge. On \u201cMurder to Excellence,\u201d Jay aims to inspire: \u201cPower to the people\u00a0/ When you see me, see you.\u201d Impossible. Jay\u2019s most diamond-encrusted verses might give us the guts to fantasize beyond our means, but most of us will never touch that kind of wealth. Meanwhile, West continues to invest in the power of ego \u2014 something a recession can never take away. Because of that, \u201cWatch the Throne\u201d is his album. Only it\u2019s really our album. It might be a summer blockbuster designed to make us bow before two rap demigods, but after just a few spins, \u201cWatch the Throne\u201d asks us to question our own desires \u2014 spiritual and material. Instead of watching the throne, we end up gazing deep into our own navels. richardsc@washpost.com Recommended tracks:\u201cMurder to Excellence,\u201d \u201cNew Day,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s My [Expletive]\u201d  Jay-Z and Kanye West are scheduled to perform at Baltimore\u2019s 1st Mariner Arena on Nov. 1 and the District\u2019s Verizon Center on Nov. 3.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-08 17:57:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlifestylestylewatch-the-throne-by-jay-z-and-kanye-west20110808giqavs5j3i_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 108, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Md. couponing expert teaches the art and science of saving through clipping", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/couponing-expert-teaches-the-art-and-science-of-saving-through-clipping/2011/08/05/gIQAdZyC1I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\t\u201cDo y\u2019all know what the Clipper is?\u201d Kimberly Pepper-Hoctor asked her class one recent night in a library meeting room about an hour south of Washington. A woman sitting near the front stirred her purse and extracted the latest edition of the Clipper, a direct-mail magazine loaded with coupons. She held it up for the 24 other mostly middle-age women who had come to learn as much as they could about paying as little as possible for their groceries and other household goods. \u201cI like you,\u201d Pepper-Hoctor told her new teacher\u2019s pet, who smiled broadly.  Pepper-Hoctor is a veteran bargain hunter who probably has enough severely discounted toiletries at home to stock your basic Presidential Emergency Operations Center. And she is a couponing instructor, a vocation born of the recession. The 42-year-old Navy wife, who tends to walk out of Target paying half of what the people behind her do for the same stuff, instructs women around Southern Maryland how they, too, can spend less to buy more. She originally shared her secrets and strategies with other military spouses, but she has recently opened her Charlotte Hall classes to the public with a buy-none-get-one-free offer: Pepper-Hoctor doesn\u2019t charge for the classes, which sets her apart from the burgeoning nationwide community of couponing experts. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help people save money,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would I charge them?\u201d \u2018I don\u2019t like paying full price\u2019 Driven by the obvious economic forces and celebrated on the cable show \u201cExtreme Couponing\u201d \u2014 in which scheming shoppers treat bargain-hunting as a competitive sport and often wind up with enough products to open their own surplus stores \u2014 coupon use has spiked over the past few years, with more people piling up more savings than ever. In 2007, the year before the economy cratered, 63 percent of American shoppers used coupons \u201cregularly,\u201d according to NCH Marketing Services, a coupon clearinghouse. That year, $2.6\u2009billion worth of manufacturers\u2019 coupons were redeemed. In 2010, the numbers were up to 78\u2009percent and $3.7 billion. This year, manufacturers have issued fewer coupons than during the same period last year, but redemption rates are rising, according to NCH. With \u201ccouponing\u201d popular enough that the verb has entered the mainstream lexicon, some women have been marketing their self-taught expertise in the art and science of saving: You can buy their instructional DVDs on supercouponing, and you can pay to attend their couponing seminars or book them for personalized classes. Increasingly these days, a penny saved is a penny learned. More than 50 people have signed up for Pepper-Hoctor\u2019s free class Aug. 15 in Leonardtown in St. Mary\u2019s County. \u201cI might have to add a second one,\u201d she said. Pepper-Hoctor was a couponer when couponing wasn\u2019t cool, long before Groupon kick-started the Internet-based social coupon craze. She started clipping 30 years ago with her mother. She never stopped, even when she held a six-figure corporate communications job on the West Coast. (She doesn\u2019t work at the moment because of health problems.) \u201cI don\u2019t like paying full price,\u201d she told the class. She is branding herself with a motto: The Girl Loves Coupons. Her standard lesson plan includes everything from a quick rundown of stores that double coupons to a long, involved explanation of \u201cpiggybacking,\u201d in which combinations of store and manufacturer coupons are used to get the deepest possible discounts.  \u201cWe also call that \u2018stacking,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. The students were rapt. Some took notes. \u2018Putting together a puzzle\u2019 \u201cLet\u2019s go to Walgreens,\u201d Pepper-Hoctor said several hours before her class at the library in Charlotte Hall. She aimed her sport-utility vehicle across the Patuxent River, through Solomons Island and into Lusby, to the nearest Walgreens. She was determined to redeem a rain check for Bounty paper towels, which had been marked down to $1.59. She had some $1 off coupons, but there was no Bounty to buy the last time she\u2019d been to the store. She wanted that deal. Of course, she had additional items on her shopping list, a multipage, color-coded spreadsheet created the previous Sunday, as always, after a trip to Panera with her husband, Navy Chief Warrant Officer Thomas Hoctor. They\u2019d brought two copies of the Sunday Washington Post, and for the better part of two hours, while he read, she circled notable deals in the store ads and clipped coupons, which she organized in a red Mead binder divided by product type: paper products, skin care, hair care, eye care, dental, cleaning supplies, cereal, condiments, Mexican, beverages and so forth. The spreadsheet organized products by store, with columns for price, size, extra incentives, restrictions and final price. The relevant coupons were eventually organized into envelopes, one for each store.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to fool anybody,\u201d Pepper-Hoctor said. \u201cThe reality is that couponing is going to take some time. And then when you actually go shopping, it\u2019s going to take more time. Finding the best price is like putting together a puzzle.\u201d She grabbed a cart and a Walgreens coupon booklet, opened her binder and aimed for the aisles. \u201cLet\u2019s see what toothpaste is on sale here,\u201d she chirped. \u2018Kim is .\u2009.\u2009. prepared\u2019 At the three-bedroom home Pepper-Hoctor shares with her husband and two dogs in a development seven miles from the naval air station, the storage closets and cabinets were packed. There were 20 boxes of tissue paper and too many containers of Febreeze and Softsoap to count. There were also surpluses of shaving cream, men\u2019s deodorant, toilet paper and Ziploc bags. \u201cKim is .\u2009.\u2009. prepared,\u201d Thomas Hoctor said. He laughed. \u201cBut I can\u2019t complain. I won\u2019t ever say: \u2018Oh, man, I have to go to the store to get shaving cream.\u2019 All I have to do is go to the hall closet and get it. I joke to people when they stay with us: You\u2019re getting your own roll of toilet paper, some deodorant, a box of Puffs and a personal tube of toothpaste. It\u2019s like the Hoctor Inn.\u201d Before shopping, Pepper-Hoctor had looked at the explosion of toothpaste in a closet near her bedroom and guessed that there were 35 tubes. \u201cWe need to donate some,\u201d she said. \u201cBut toothpaste is the easiest thing to get free. Most of it was either free or I paid 50 cents for it.\u201d Still, she said, at least there weren\u2019t, say, 50 bottles of mustard in the house, a la \u201cExtreme Couponing.\u201d She has her limits. \u201cSome of those people are borderline hoarders,\u201d she said. At Walgreens, Pepper-Hoctor picked up a six-ounce tube of Arm & Hammer toothpaste.  \u201cIt\u2019s $3.99, and then \u2018buy one get one free,\u2019 and then I have two coupons for it at $1 apiece.\u201d The regular price was $4.29 each; Pepper-Hoctor could buy four for $4.98. She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going to go ahead and get them. We don\u2019t use these, but my mom does. I\u2019ll send it to her.\u201d Into the basket and onward. From aisle to aisle she went, picking up a couple of cheaper-than-usual bottles of vitamins, including Flintstones Gummies (\u201cThey\u2019re pretty good,\u201d she said), and three boxes of Old El Paso taco shells for 79 cents each (they\u2019re usually $2.29) and a six-pack of Expo washable dry erase markers for $2.99 \u2014 $7 off the list price. Up Aisle 10, over to five, through three, back to 10, over to seven, side trip to the clearance section on one, just in case there was a deal she couldn\u2019t refuse. She\u2019d been in the store an hour. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even a big shopping trip,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why my husband hates going shopping with me.\u201d A Walgreens clerk stocking mascara saw Pepper-Hoctor riffling through her coupon envelope. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to plug it up,\u201d she said of the main checkout line, \u201cwe can make it easier.\u201d She told Pepper-Hoctor to come see her at the cash register near makeup when she was ready. The order totaled $136.87, including more than $40 in store markdowns. \u201cNow,\u201d said the clerk, \u201clet\u2019s whittle it down.\u201d She looked at the expiration date of each of the 24 coupons and checked to make sure she\u2019d rung up the corresponding item.  The total shrank to $94.87. Pepper-Hoctor nodded. \u201cI saved $86 \u2014 nearly half.\u201d She rolled the cart to the parking lot and loaded the SUV. It had been 90 minutes. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Target next. I have a big shop to do there.\u201d \u2018A little bit of a high\u2019 The coupon was born in 1886, when John Pemberton handed out drink cards around Atlanta, offering free samples of his new creation, Coca-Cola. The promotional coupons took off when the Coke formula was sold to druggist Asa Candler, who direct-mailed coupons to customers who lived near soda fountains. The promotion seemed to work just fine for Coca-Cola and marketers. Last year, more than 330 billion coupons were distributed in the United States \u2014 a record level, said Charlie Brown, an executive with NCH and co-chairman of the Promotion Marketing Association\u2019s Coupon Council. Fewer are being offered this year, Brown said, but redemption volume is on the rise. \u201cWe saw in our consumer research that in 2010, the No. 1 reason people said they were using more coupons was because they liked saving money,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat\u2019s different than what we saw in 2009, when the top reason was they needed to stretch their budget. Once people started using coupons to a greater degree due to the recession, it became part of their shopping habits. There\u2019s a sense of enjoyment when you get that feeling of being a smart, savvy shopper.\u201d The discount is only part of the calculus, said Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavior economics at Duke University. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that you have to do something to get the financial reward, so your skills are connected to it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes you feel that you\u2019re in control and are successful.\u201d  On a more base level, Ariely said, saving money with coupons could be a dopamine trigger. At Target, while zigzagging in search of the best deals on deodorant and Febreeze and makeup, Pepper-Hoctor had a revelation. It came as she realized she was getting a package of ballpoint pens for free.  \u201cI do get a little bit of a high from saving money,\u201d she said. \u2018They\u2019re like trophies\u2019 Jennifer Hunt, not long out of college, now working for the St. Mary\u2019s County Department of Aging, was the youngest of 25 students in Pepper-Hoctor\u2019s class in Charlotte Hall. She brought some coupons with her, as well as a receipt from a recent trip to Rite Aid.  \u201cI got four things of Noxzema razors for free,\u201d she boasted. In couponing circles, bargain-bragging is encouraged. Hunt sometimes posts her best deals on Facebook. \u201cThey\u2019re like trophies,\u201d she said. Pepper-Hoctor urged her flock to manage its expectations. \u201cExtreme Couponing\u201d is an unrealistic reality show, she said. \u201cYou won\u2019t always get free stuff.\u201d During the hour-long class, her tips came at a dizzying pace. Set up an e-mail address dedicated to couponing, \u201cbecause you\u2019re going to get spammed a lot.\u201d Use Firefox instead of Internet Explorer to print online coupons. Get to know the managers at the stores where you do most of your shopping. Sign up for this, look up that, watch this video for extra coupons!  Then she gave away a binder just like the one she used for couponing, randomly drawing a student\u2019s name. \u201cI picked it up at Target today,\u201d she said, adding (even though it was self-evident): \u201cI got a pretty good deal, with a coupon.\u201d dulacj@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-07 16:29:33", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocalcouponing-expert-teaches-the-art-and-science-of-saving-through-clipping20110805giqadzyc1i_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 231, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:31:50", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:10", "headline": "Alec Baldwin to open new season on NBC\u2019s \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/alec-baldwin-to-open-new-season-on-nbcs-saturday-night-live/2011/08/12/gIQAAKM1AJ_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tNEW YORK \u2014 Alec Baldwin earns bragging rights as the most familiar \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d host when he opens the NBC show\u2019s 37th season on Sept. 24.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt will be his 16th time as host.

But rather than taking offense, Murdoch\u2019s onetime friend and now bitter rival called the head of Mediaset, the flagship television company in which Berlusconi has a controlling interest, to discuss Murdoch\u2019s diminished physical state. \u201cHe was touched,\u201d said Fedele Confalonieri, Mediaset\u2019s president, who is Berlusconi\u2019s oldest friend. He and Berlusconi talked about how Murdoch \u201cwas changed. He looked older, less hair, and also he had some difficulties in hearing.\u201d During an interview in the 19th-century corporate headquarters of Berlusconi\u2019s media empire here, Confalonieri likened Murdoch to King Lear, then waxed philosophical, saying, \u201cThe humiliation of a mighty person is always something that touches you.\u201d Confalonieri asserts that Murdoch and Berlusconi are \u201cgood fellows,\u201d but there may be other motives for the Italians\u2019 expressions of compassion. Berlusconi and his generals have a vested interest in depicting Murdoch as a has-been who, as Confalonieri put it, has been \u201cweakened from the point of view of morality\u201d by a scandal that has revealed his \u201ctrue nature\u201d as \u201caggressive,\u201d \u201cnot honest\u201d and, if the accusations against his company are true, \u201cshameful.\u201d This is a critical stage in the clash of the media tycoons. In the past, both billionaires have demonstrated their mastery of using the media\u2019s power to gain political influence, and then using that influence to further the interests of their business empires in the heavily regulated media industry. But now both Murdoch and Berlusconi have suffered a summer of scandal and setbacks that have weakened their political clout. Their shared need for good business news has only sharpened their rivalry over who will rule the Italian airwaves. \u201cAs a media tycoon, you have to be involved in politics,\u201d said Fabrizio Perretti, a professor at Bocconi University in Milan who studies the Italian media industry. \u201cBut when you are too close and favor one party, as Murdoch has done, or enter politics yourself, as Berlusconi has, at that point you risk losing all the things you had before.\u201d Murdoch is reeling from a scandal that has rocked his power in Britain and possibly beyond. In Italy, Murdoch owns Sky Italia, a satellite broadcaster that, since its founding in 2003, has come to dominate Italy\u2019s pay-television business with about 5 million subscribers. Continued success and expansion here would go a long way toward quashing the notion that his is an empire in decline. For his part, Berlusconi has to contend with Italy\u2019s impending economic disaster while he continues to face a political scandal in which he is accused of paying an underage woman for sex. But several incidents in July directly affected the media business that is the source of his political power.  An Italian appeals court ordered the investment arm of Berlusconi\u2019s company to pay $795 million in damages to a rival Italian media company for corruption in the acquisition of the Mondadori publishing company in the 1990s. Berlusconi, who has a track record of instituting laws tailor-made for his own protection, sought to insert a measure into Italy\u2019s emergency austerity package that would have suspended the payment of such fines until the country\u2019s supreme court issued a final ruling on his appeal. But this time, public pressure forced him to withdraw the provision. A few days later, Berlusconi lost a vote that would have protected one of his party\u2019s members of Parliament from arrest on corruption charges. As prime minister, Berlusconi oversees the government-run television networks, giving him direct or indirect control of six of the seven national channels \u2014 and also the political power to protect his business interests, which he has not been shy about using. Since 2005, Mediaset has also challenged Sky Italia in the pay-TV sector by seeking to convert subscribers to its digital terrestrial platform, which is an alternative to satellite and cable technologies. On Jan. 1, European Union restrictions will expire, allowing Sky to compete directly in Mediaset\u2019s free-television wheelhouse. * * * Sky\u2019s headquarters are located in Santa Giulia, on the outskirts of Milan, in a tangle of scaffolding, construction cranes and half-built housing projects. The two-year-old, 18,000-square-meter building has a glass facade with SKY written across the front in bubble lettering. On Wednesday afternoon, scores of attractive young employees smoked and sipped coffee on a fifth-floor terrace. The gleaming white lobby featured promotions by Italian movie and soccer stars advertising the Italian version of DVR technology. Executives at Sky Italia like to say that the building is a manifestation of their commitment to competing in Italy, and that when Berlusconi first laid eyes on it, he uttered an expletive. They argue that they have created thousands of jobs, introduced high-definition television to the country and provided Italian viewers with more choices in soccer coverage and entertainment programming than they ever thought possible. \u201cWhen we started in 2003, nearly every commentator said this was crazy,\u201d said Andrea Scrosati, Sky\u2019s vice president for production and promotions. He declared the company \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with its performance in recent months, despite the \u201cparticular competitive environment\u201d created by Berlusconi\u2019s unique double role as professional rival and prime minister of the country. Scrosati argued that while News Corp.\u2019s issues were serious, they were not as prominent for the Italian voter as some other scandals in the news. \u201cReally, this is a country that has very big issues in this moment,\u201d Scrosati said. A tour of the facilities showcased state-of-the-art technology. In one control room, two dozen flat-screen televisions displayed digital grids of small pictures so technicians could monitor all of Sky\u2019s 220 channels at a glance. An alarm sounded whenever any of the channels had a technical problem. Downstairs, robot\u00adically controlled cameras taped a sports-news program, workers set up seats for a live broadcast promoting the network\u2019s 2012 Olympic coverage and leggy young women awaiting auditions paced nervously in front of Studio 5. An empty studio, bathed in red light, sat ready for Milan feeds to the broadcaster\u2019s Rome-based news show, which has carved out a niche in polarized Italy by delivering generally objective reports. Sky Italia is not operating in a balanced political environment. Its executives have complained that a law passed in December 2008 by Berlusconi\u2019s government hiked their tax rates to damage Sky and boost Mediaset. Other regulations and proposed restrictions objected to by Sky included a reduction of advertising allowed on pay TV, which has led to a deluge of Sky advertising in the nation\u2019s train stations and on roadside billboards. Sky executives also argue that Berlusconi\u2019s government narrowed the window for adult programming on Sky\u2019s channels, which Sky considers a curious paroxysm of morality given the prevalence of exposed female flesh on Berlusconi\u2019s channels. Yet Sky\u2019s success in signing up new subscribers despite such obstacles has boosted its prestige within a suddenly sullied empire. That good standing was reflected on July 15, when Murdoch appointed the company\u2019s respected chief executive, Tom Mockridge, to head News Corp.\u2019s teetering British operation, News International.  Mockridge \u2014 who last June decried Berlusconi\u2019s attempt to restrict media use of leaked wiretaps as \u201cwrong\u201d \u2014 replaced Rebekah Brooks, who was arrested in connection with the scandal. On Aug. 1, James Murdoch released a statement introducing Sky\u2019s new chief executive, Andrea Zappia, writing, \u201cI look forward very much to working with him as we take Sky Italia into its next phase of development.\u201d * * * Berlusconi\u2019s son, Pier Silvio, is Mediaset\u2019s vice chairman, and he hopes to restrain James Murdoch\u2019s development. \u201cThey met, I think, two years ago,\u201d Confalonieri said of the two scions. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t hit it off.\u201d That is hardly surprising given the breakdown in communication between their fathers. \u201cIt is curious, the relationship with Mr. Rupert,\u201d said Confalonieri. \u201cBecause we were friends.\u201d In 1993, Berlusconi expressed public interest in selling Mediaset to Murdoch, though the two men could never settle on a price. Berlusconi\u2019s boosters insist that the prime minister decided against the sale because Pier Silvio expressed a keen interest in carrying on the family business. Berlusconi\u2019s associates refer to this flirting with Murdoch as evidence of Berlusconi\u2019s early intentions to rid himself of his conflict of interest as he considered entering politics. Berlusconi\u2019s detractors consider the talks mere window-dressing. In any case, the negotiations allowed the two moguls to forge something of a friendship over lunches at Berlusconi\u2019s villa in Sardinia. Berlusconi bought Murdoch\u2019s boat, the Morning Glory, and Berlusconi\u2019s government allowed Murdoch to consolidate satellite providers and create Sky Italia. Relations soured when Berlusconi entered the pay-television market using digital terrestrial technology. \u201cThis is the origin of our conflict,\u201d Confalonieri said. \u201cI remember we met [Murdoch] in New York and he was obviously not very happy because we were a competitor.\u201d Any remaining warmth between the two ended after Berlusconi\u2019s government passed a decree that raised Sky\u2019s taxes. The Murdoch-owned Times of London enthusiastically covered Berlusconi\u2019s 2009 relationship with an 18-year-old model. That year, Berlusconi made the billionaire breakup official by telling Mediaset\u2019s Canale 5, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be nasty, but unfortunately with the [tax] episode there was a breakdown in relations with the Sky group and with Murdoch\u2019s group, which has published a series of very critical articles attacking me.\u201d Murdoch, whose Sky Italia lost business at the end of 2009, responded at the time by telling his own Fox Business Network, \u201cI don\u2019t control what the editor of the Times says in London or the Economist, which have been attacking him, saying it\u2019s a disgrace to have him as prime minister for the last five years.\u201d He showed up at Sky Italia headquarters to denounce the tax in the midst of a global recession. Ads appeared on Sky excoriating the Berlusconi government, and an effort was made to poach Berlusconi\u2019s top talent, including Rosario Fiorello, a popular Sicilian showman. At his palace in Rome, Berlusconi sought in vain to persuade the entertainer not to work for \u201cthe enemy,\u201d as Fiorello recounted to Italian reporters. In the interview in Milan, Confalonieri denied that Mediaset has ever benefited from Berlusconi\u2019s role as head of state. \u201cOf course Mr. Berlusconi has a conflict of interest,\u201d Confalonieri said. \u201cBut it is so clear and so transparent.\u201d By contrast, Confalonieri depicted Murdoch\u2019s influence as more sinister. He argued that slipping into 10 Downing Street through the back door to sway the British government, or presenting a perspective in Italy more in line with Berlus\u00adconi\u2019s detractors in the left-leaning opposition, was at least as bad. \u201cSo the tricky competitor can be something like in tennis: The ball can be on both sides of the net.\u201d horowitzj@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-07 17:00:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlifestylestylefacing-their-own-troubles-berlusconi-and-murdoch-square-off20110803giqa1q8g1i_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 112, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "At IPO-ready LivingSocial, you get the deals \u2014 and it gets the riches", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/at-ipo-ready-livingsocial-you-get-the-deals--and-it-gets-the-riches/2011/07/29/gIQAzx3SwI_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tLivingSocial had wrapped up its most lucrative month ever, and its four founders were sprawled around an Ikea conference table with their investors in a brick-walled office above the Hooters in Chinatown. It was a bright July morning in 2009. The initial business was building widgets for Facebook, leveraging its customer base of hundreds of millions of users. The group downed Starbucks coffee and noshed on cookies while working through the agenda. Then chief executive Tim O\u2019Shaughnessy, flanked by Tige Savage, a key investor on the company\u2019s board, dropped a bomb: What if they abandoned it all to make a big bet on something called the vouchers business? Mostly silence. This bold turn would propel the company beyond building cool gizmos. The just-emerging daily-deals trade would mean hiring salespeople. Selling to merchants. Selling to customers. Retail. \u201cIt was completely different from the apps business, which was our bread and butter,\u201d co-founder Eddie Frederick said.\u201cThe daily deals didn\u2019t really leverage our existing resources.\u201d They dedicated one developer and one salesperson to the project and launched the business that LivingSocial\u2019s millions of subscribers use today. You know the drill: Once you sign up, you get an e-mail each day with an offer \u2014 say $30 worth of Indian food for $15. You buy the deal with a credit card. LivingSocial then gives you a voucher, which you use to settle up with the merchant once you\u2019ve had your curry. After two years and scads of deals, LivingSocial is preparing for an initial public stock offering that analysts say could raise $1 billion. With coupons? Really? Well, there\u2019s more. LivingSocial and its larger rival Groupon have pioneered a new form of local advertising, one that exploits the massive scale of the Internet to drive customers into brick-and-mortar businesses. In no time, the company has become the most aggressive private employer in the District \u2014 adding 600 jobs in less than two years. The churn has turned heads in Maryland and Virginia, where officials are hungry to create jobs. LivingSocial\u2019s reach has extended worldwide, with 40 million subscribers in 25 countries (to Groupon\u2019s 43) from Asia to Western Europe to South America. Its global growth is fueled mostly by acquisitions. Last week, for instance, it snapped up a South Korean company with 2 million members and 600 employees. When LivingSocial begins selling shares to the public, a process expected to be put in motion as early as this week, O\u2019Shaughnessy, 29, and his team will become multimillionaires \u2014 on paper at least. Investors who put $100,000 into LivingSocial just a year ago could hold shares worth as much as $5 million, depending on how the company is valued. It all snapped into place at the \u201cHooters meeting,\u201d as it is known among LivingSocial insiders. The founders had been on a quest for a business with blockbuster potential. With the daily deals, they thought they had it. Despite LivingSocial\u2019s meteoric rise, skeptics are taking a wait-and-see approach to a valuation in the billions. After all, competitors crop up daily. Consumers might feel bombarded by e-mails. Merchants could soon resent the steep discounts. \u201cThere is a tremendous amount of opportunity. But this is the pie-in-the-sky stuff,\u201d said Peter Krasilovsky, an industry analyst at market-research firm BIA/Kelsey. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a track record for their success in this area.\u201d The founders Co-founders Frederick, Val Aleksenko and Aaron Batalion met O\u2019Shaughnessy at Revolution Health, a Web site funded by AOL co-founder Steve Case. They bonded over beers and brainstorms at the Brickskeller, the now-shuttered saloon known for its vast brew selection. \u201cNights and weekends, we would drink beers and spin around [ideas of] what can we go do, what can we build?\u201d Batalion said. \u201cAnd one of the things we came upon was Facebook.\u201d The social network had launched in Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Harvard dorm room in 2004 but was quickly adding millions of users and captivating technologists \u2014 not to mention investors hungry for the next Google \u2014 from Silicon Valley and beyond. In May 2007, the company opened its platform to outside developers. Big brands such as Disney and its sports subsidiary, ESPN, were shelling out substantial sums to technologists who could connect them to Facebook. So the four set up a consultancy with O\u2019Shaughnessy as the chief executive. He reeled in the customers; the others wrote the code. \u201cWithout those four guys, this wouldn\u2019t have worked,\u201d Savage said. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual. It\u2019s a very complementary team. We loved the team. We bet on the guys.\u201d Frederick, 30, has a knack for luring crowds to Web sites \u2014 a constant struggle for Internet start-ups. With a thick head of long hair and an open-neck shirt, he typifies the company culture, which is one step removed from a dorm room. His is a deeply analytical mind known to crunch numbers into tangible results. Aleksenko, at 39 the oldest of the four, hails from Ukraine. With a rich accent and unassuming demeanor, he\u2019s the shy infrastructure guy who keeps the Web operations humming as millions of users pour in daily. Batalion, 31, who sprinkles conversations with references to \u201cscale,\u201d has a reputation for growing a business not by pouring fuel on the fire but by drenching it until an inferno roars. The four geeks immediately grasped Facebook\u2019s potential. With its immense scale \u2014 Facebook now has 750 million users spending 700 billion minutes a month on its site \u2014 the social-network phenom is the 21st-century version of the Interstate highway system, creating thousands of new business opportunities by virtue of its size and reach. With a vast market reaching into nearly every U.S. household, it delivers an audience not seen since the heyday of television. \u201cThe platform itself was incredible,\u201d Aleksenko said. The four were building a profitable business that brought in several millions of dollars a year. \u201cThey were really easy apps for us to crank out,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cSome of these apps we would build in a couple days and make like 50k.\u201d For many people, that would\u2019ve been enough. But they wanted a business with scale, one with explosive growth and revenue. Aleksenko put it this way: \u201cDo we want to make a few million for ourselves next year or potentially make way more in four or five years?\u201d They made the call outside a restaurant in San Diego in December 2007. O\u2019Shaughnessy would close out their existing contracts in a month or two. No longer the middlemen, they would build their own businesses from the ground up and the apps to go with them. \u201cWe wanted to play big,\u201d Aleksenko said. The investors Tige Savage oozes technocrat. Thin, neat and focused, he speaks in functional, precise sentences like the algorithms many of his businesses are built on. He uses words like \u201ccheckmark\u201d and \u201corthogonal.\u201d  Savage, 42, is a gatekeeper to the millions of dollars in venture capital money at Steve Case\u2019s Revolution LLC, the investment firm on Washington\u2019s Rhode Island Avenue where Savage serves as managing director. \u201cSteve and I were in the chairs, and Tim sat on the couch,\u201d said Savage, recalling a meeting in Case\u2019s 10th floor office. \u201cHe knew Steve and I were Facebook users. So he brought his little white Mac laptop and opened it up and said: \u2018I think there\u2019s something going on here. And here\u2019s why.\u2019 He presented it in a very clear case.\u201d Even so, Savage was most intrigued by the four founders\u2019 compatibility and their broader ambition to tap the information shared on Facebook to connect users with relevant advertisers. \u201cHe didn\u2019t overpromise,\u201d Savage said. \u201cHe was just very thoughtful.\u201d Savage and Case pledged their financial support when the time was right. O\u2019Shaughnessy, who is the son-in-law of Washington Post Co. Chairman Donald E. Graham, also made the pilgrimage to Grotech, Don Rainey\u2019s venture capital firm in Tysons Corner. Five minutes into the meeting, Rainey remembers thinking, \u201cThis guy is just like the first guy who made me a fortune.\u201d That was Chris Evans, whose start-up in the early 1990s put banner ads on Web sites. It was eventually worth $2.5 billion. O\u2019Shaughnessy was a dead ringer for him. \u201cHis attitude, instincts, the way he saw the world,\u201d Rainey said. He said he realized that he had to give him whatever he wanted. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do when you meet someone like that,\u201d Rainey said. \u201cI am going to give this guy money because I am not going to miss that train.\u201d O\u2019Shaughnessy ran back to the company\u2019s offices above an antiques shop on P Street NW and told his co-founders that they\u2019d found their money man. In July 2008, Revolution and Grotech were LivingSocial\u2019s first institutional investors, eventually putting $5 million into the company \u2014 a sum that could be returned hundreds of times over. The daily-deals business wouldn\u2019t even emerge for another year. O\u2019Shaughnessy and company sold investors on the promise of something called Pick Your Five, where users shared their favorite books, music and beer with friends. The company then sold advertising space to retailers. Its audience rocketed from zero to 35 million people in three weeks, making it the most popular Facebook application until Zynga debuted its social game Farmville. \u201cThe Pick Your Five thing was so viral and so explosive that the day before we launched it, we were kind of lost, and the day after we launched it, we were 100\u00a0percent focused,\u201d Frederick said. That breakthrough sent them looking for something bigger and better. The company acquired a small, plainly named outfit called Buy Your Friend a Drink \u2014 known as BYFAD among the founders. It wasn\u2019t an obvious fit for a tech company at first. It distributed online vouchers for free drinks at local bars, which seized on the marketing opportunity. The entire process was bankrolled by the alcohol industry. The side business taught the founders that online behavior could be leveraged to influence in-the-flesh decisions beyond bars. Why not sell bikes or photography classes or vacations? Savage and O\u2019Shaughnessy were thinking nationally, even globally. The others were skeptical.  Explosive growthAs they listened to the pitch above the Hooters that July day, Frederick, Batalion and Aleksenko were wary of dropping a proven business for one that was untested. \u201cFor three founders who are from a technical background,\u201d Aleksenko said, \u201cit\u2019s a big leap of faith.\u201d On July 27, 2009, the first deal sold 53 vouchers for a D.C. sushi restaurant, most of which were bought by friends, relatives or the founders themselves. Within four months, the company was chasing Groupon, the Chicago-based market leader, which had launched sites in several cities and had begun amassing a sales force. LivingSocial would need to quickly move into new cities and find subscribers who would buy vouchers to use at local businesses. Frederick was the expert at \u201cuser acquisition,\u201d or the art of collecting the e-mails necessary to build a customer base. \u201cWhenever you have a really effective product like that, it\u2019s a race to scale .\u2009.\u2009. raise more capital and fuel the machine,\u201d Frederick said. Frederick\u2019s trick was to advertise in a city months before the site\u2019s debut there, essentially buying customers cheaply before they got into a market brawl with the competition, Savage said. By December 2009, the company had expanded into five U.S cities. A year later, it had entered 130. In July, thanks to acquisitions and majority ownership in other dealmakers, it counted 487 markets worldwide. \u201cWe bet the company, and we went out and massively acquired the English-speaking world,\u201d Savage said. But the costs to scale also came fast and large. LivingSocial has hired as many as six or eight people a day, flying dozens at a time into the District for weekend interviews. Once hired, they return home to make deals with merchants face-to-face. This boots-on-the-ground approach is one way in which the company\u2019s leaders feel they\u2019ve distinguished themselves from Groupon, where most of the sales force calls merchants from its Chicago-based headquarters. In February 2010 \u2014 on a weekend Washingtonians will remember as Snowmageddon \u2014 Savage had an epiphany. They\u2019d run a deal in Washington for brunch at the Kennedy Center and a spa deal in Seattle, \u201cwhere you come in and get a juice and get your toenails painted.\u201d It sold like gangbusters, and they made more in a day than the whole month before. His aha moment, he said, was this: \u201cNot only are we betting that there\u2019s money in them thar hills, but we just hit our first vein of gold.\u2019\u201d The competition Groupon, of course, is running for those same hills. Executives at Groupon declined to comment for this article via a spokesman, citing a quiet period following their June 2 registration with the SEC to go public. In that filing, the company said that having its U.S. sales force concentrated in one office has proved a boon for productivity rather than a detriment, allowing it to quickly make decisions and changes. LivingSocial has faced constant comparison to the older and bigger Groupon, not unlike a younger sibling trying to stand out. LivingSocial\u2019s executives and investors are quick to note the distinct facets of their business. In fact, although they concede that Groupon is the originator of daily deals, LivingSocial fancies itself the innovator. Its variations on the ubiquitous daily deal e-mails, including an on-the-go service called Instant Deals and travel-specific discounts called Escapes, launched before Groupon unveiled similar services. \u201cEvery business iterates,\u201d O\u2019Shaughnessy said. \u201cIn the technology space, the innovation cycles tend to be faster than in the physical, real world.\u201d Krasilovsky contends that turning the companies\u2019 subscribers on to other products is the key to a sustainable business. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that if they don\u2019t make the transition to a broader platform soon that the initial business model may fall flat,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that both companies have moved very responsibly to create a compelling extension of that business.\u201d But both business models also rely heavily on the satisfaction of local merchants. And the companies have been criticized by merchants and customers alike. There have been tales of restaurants overrun by coupon customers. Others have complained that the companies take too much of a cut from the deal. Some deals were marketed in the wrong geographic area. Some customers have complained about mix-ups when redeeming the coupons. Ann Said, owner of Eco Safe Maids, a local cleaning service for upscale homeowners, said it took about a year from the time she submitted an online request to LivingSocial until the deal ran. And when it did, the deal was targeted at Northern Virginia customers, though Eco Safe\u2019s clientele is concentrated in the District. \u201cWe were a bit upset about it,\u201d she said. Both LivingSocial and Groupon make the bulk of their revenue by sharing in the price that customers pay for a voucher, typically collecting 30 to 50 percent off the top. The future O\u2019Shaughnessy, now at the helm of the fastest-growing private business in Washington, sips a Diet Coke at his desk. The sparsely decorated office has two framed photos of him and his wife and a freezer full of ice cream with a large stuffed monkey on top. The asphalt at New York Avenue and 14th Street NW radiates heat on a July afternoon. It\u2019s the newest of five D.C. offices the company occupies as it adds square footage almost as fast as it adds people. Outside O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s office, the LivingSocial troops beaver away, dressed in shorts and flip-flops, bicycles parked against walls. It\u2019s a young operation, reflective of the young mavericks who founded it. Mistakes? \u201cI would have been even more aggressive,\u201d O\u2019Shaughnessy said, referring to the days when LivingSocial was staking out cities to beat the competition to the spot. \u201cEspecially in those early months. I wish we had even gone harder .\u2009.\u2009. because a user that you could have gotten into your ecosystem or a city that you could have launched three months earlier, you can never acquire that user again.\u201d As he parries questions on going public, a public relations specialist sits nearby. The chief executive gives a polished answer, likely vetted by attorneys. The company could go four ways: expire, stay private and pay dividends, get bought or go public. LivingSocial is down to two: getting bought or going public. We will see, he said. Next to the door stands a makeshift wine rack with about a dozen bottles, mementos to cheer the company\u2019s success. He has yet to be open them. But the corks could come out soon. On a shelf nearby is another gift: a clear engraved plaque. It reads: \u201cToday\u2019s Mavericks. Tomorrow\u2019s Millionaires.\u201d overlys@washpost.com heatht@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-06 19:50:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcombusinesscapitalbusinessat-ipo-ready-livingsocial-you-get-the-deals-and-it-gets-the-riches20110729giqazx3swi_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 113, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "OnLove: \u2018I feel like I\u2019m in high school again\u2019", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/weddings/on-love-i-feel-like-im-in-high-school-again/2011/07/27/gIQAYoFpuI_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tSteve Phillips finally joined Match.com in 2007.  He\u2019d been divorced for several years and, between working as an electrical engineer, volunteering as a firefighter and raising three teenage boys, he wasn\u2019t meeting a lot of single women. One of the first women to catch his eye online was Christina White, a vivacious blonde. They traded messages and went on a few dates, but, he says, it was \u201cobvious that  it wasn\u2019t gonna work \u2014 nothing was there.\u201d But the two stayed in touch, occasionally trading messages about their dating frustrations. In September 2008, when she invited him to join her and some friends at a bar near his house, he said he\u2019d stop by. Amy Jones was excited to meet him. She and White had been colleagues for almost a decade, and White had persuaded her to move to Northern Virginia from Richmond a month earlier. Ever since Jones arrived, White had been talking about how great her friend Steve was. \u201cI think you\u2019d really like each other,\u201d White told her. \u201cHe needs somebody, and you need somebody.\u201d But Jones wasn\u2019t so sure that she needed somebody at that moment. She was just a few years out from her second divorce and worried she would repeat the mistake she made after the first one: jumping too quickly into a new relationship.  \u201cI was just having fun,\u201d she says. \u201cI had no problem going out with people, but I definitely was not looking for a serious relationship.\u201d She was too busy trying to make new friends to notice that Phillips was a couple of hours late. When he finally walked in, she noted that he was attractive and reserved, but she didn\u2019t spend much time chatting with him at the bar.  Later that night, the group retired to White\u2019s back deck for wine and conversation. Their numbers soon dwindled, and Phillips and Jones found themselves alone. They talked about their hobbies, careers and ex-spouses, about his boys and her teenage son and daughter. It was almost 4 a.m. when he stood up to leave. On his way out, he kissed her and asked whether he could see her the next day.  \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in high school again,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could just tell they had a spark and really liked each other,\u201d White says. \u201cAlmost immediately, I was like, Ooh, I think I did good!\u201d The next night Phillips picked Jones up, told her she looked beautiful, took her to dinner and drove her home. \u201cI felt like I\u2019d just gone on the traditional date that I would always expect but that a lot of men don\u2019t do anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was great.\u201d When she came down with a cold a few days later, he brought her soup and stayed at her side until she fell asleep. And when she got lost driving home from an excursion in the Blue Ridge Mountains the following week, he guided her home over the phone. A few days later, he gave her a GPS system. \u201cExcept for when I was a child and my parents took care of me, I haven\u2019t been treated that good in 30 years,\u201d says Jones, now 38. \u201cHe spoiled me right off the bat.\u201d After she mentioned her New Year\u2019s resolution to try something new each week, he  helped plan trips to Bluemont Vineyard in Virginia, Atlantic City, Las Vegas and New York.  Everywhere they went, Jones made new friends.  \u201cShe adds a lot of spontaneity to my life,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not really the outgoing type, so I\u2019ll follow her lead.\u201d After a year of dating, they began to talk about moving in together. Jones worried about whether they\u2019d had enough time to grieve their past relationships. But in December 2009, they made the leap and almost immediately felt comfortable sharing a home. Their kids got along, his dogs loved her and she brought furniture to fill the house that had been left mostly empty since his divorce.  Soon Jones, who\u2019d never had a big wedding or even an engagement ring, broached the subject of marriage. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you want to get married again or not,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut I want my fairy tale.\u201d This time, it was Phillips who was hesitant. \u201cMy concern was that I just didn\u2019t want to go down the road that I\u2019d been down \u2014  it was sort of devastating for me, and it took me a long time to really get over it,\u201d he says. But their friends routinely commented on how much happier he seemed. \u201cAmy kind of brings light to his life and brings fun,\u201d White says. \u201cAnd he brings stability to the relationship. They kind of balance each other out.\u201d Phillips, now 46, was reassured by their ability to talk through even tough issues and began to reconsider the idea of marriage. So, on their second anniversary, he took Jones ring-shopping. The following weekend, before they left for a family wedding, Phillips told her that she was missing something and placed the ring on her finger as his boys looked on.  The two were married on a bluff overlooking the vineyards at Bluemont as temperatures  climbed into triple digits July 23. They hired their favorite local rock  band, the Lloyd Dobler Effect, gave fans to guests and had White stand up as maid of honor.  \u201cShe wanted her fairy tale,\u201d Phillips said before the wedding. \u201cAnd I wanted her to have something special.\u201d    See more from weddings and lifestyle. mccarthye@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-04 13:55:52", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlifestyleweddingson-love-i-feel-like-im-in-high-school-again20110727giqayofpui_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 236, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:31:51", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:10", "headline": "July a \u2018very rough month\u2019 for US retail video game sales, says NPD Group", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/summer-doldrums-continue-as-npd-group-says-us-video-game-retail-sales-sunk-in-july/2011/08/11/gIQApBvZ9I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tNEW YORK \u2014 U.S. retail sales of video game hardware, software and accessories dropped 20 percent in July to $707.7 million, hurt especially by a sharp drop in demand for video game consoles, according to market researcher NPD Group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNPD analyst Anita Frazier called July a \u201cvery rough month,\u201d though she added that for the full year game sales are poised to land in the flat to down 2 percent range from 2010 levels.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe NPD Group said in its monthly report Thursday that sales of video game hardware sank 29 percent to $223 million in July from a year earlier. This includes hand-held game systems and gaming consoles like the Wii. Microsoft Corp. says its Xbox 360 was the top-selling console during the month. Even so, NPD said the console saw its first year-over-year decline last month since December 2009.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSales of software, or the video games themselves, fell 17 percent to $336.2 million. That\u2019s much worse than the 7 percent decline that Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter had expected. Sales of game accessories slid 8 percent to $127.8 million.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cThere is no getting around the fact that video game sales in the new physical retail channel suffered its lowest month since October 2006,\u201d Frazier said, referring to new, packaged video games rather than used games or game downloads, which NPD does not provide in its report.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen including PC games in addition to games for consoles and hand-held gaming devices such as the Nintendo DS, software sales tumbled 30 percent to $356.9 million.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBecause the research firm does not include game downloads and online games in its monthly retail sales data, the numbers can sometimes show a decline even if more people are playing games on Facebook, their mobile phones and elsewhere.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the big July decline does not bode well for video game publishers that still depend on selling game discs for a large portion of their revenue. Among the month\u2019s best-selling games were \u201cNCAA Football 12\u201d from Electronic Arts Inc. and \u201cCars 2\u201d from The Walt Disney Co.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJuly\u2019s lackluster sales report comes less than two weeks after Japan\u2019s Nintendo Co. cut the price of its portable 3DS gaming system to $170 from $250. The gadget, which allows for 3-D viewing without the need for special glasses, launched with much fanfare but has failed to meet expectations, due in large part to a lack of compelling games for it.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCopyright 2011 The Associated Press.

The gain signaled that Americans are a little more confident in the economy and could helped dispel fears that the country is headed for another recession.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail sales rose 0.5 percent last month, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was the best showing since March. The government also revised sales higher in the previous two months.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEven after excluding sales at gas stations, which were influenced by an increase in gas prices, sales rose 0.3 percent last month.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe better-than-expected retail sales report is the second strong signal on the economy in as many days. Stocks rose in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 120 points.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn Thursday, the Dow closed up 423 points for the day after the government said the number of people applying for unemployment benefits dropped below 400,000 for the first time since early April.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cDon\u2019t write off the American consumer or economy just yet,\u201d said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cThe solid July retail sales report should help allay recession fears.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA batch of poor data and a gloomy outlook from the Federal Reserve this week have made investors more nervous that the economy could fall back into a recession. Stock markets have tumbled in recent weeks. The Dow has lost more than 1,400 points, or more than 11 percent, since July 22.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut data for July suggest the economy may be in better shape than some had feared. Layoffs are down, retail sales are up and gas prices are falling. Employers added 117,000 net jobs last month. That\u2019s not enough to significantly lower the unemployment rate, but it was a notable improvement after two dismal months of hiring.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cThe fact that retail sales held up over the last few months even though the labor market was foundering is a positive economic development,\u201d said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cHowever, the true test will be to see if consumer activity held up in the face of recent financial market gyrations and slumping economic confidence. So the August data will be of much greater significance.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a separate report, the Commerce Department said that businesses added to their stockpiles for an 18th straight month in June. But the 0.3 percent rise in business inventories was the smallest gain in 13 months. Total business sales rose 0.4 percent after a 0.1 percent drop in May. The rebound in sales should help to bolster shaky business sentiment and spur further inventory restocking in coming months.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe retail sales report is the government\u2019s first read on consumer spending for the July-September quarter. Consumer spending is always closely watched because it accounts for 70 percent of economic growth. But in June, consumers cut spending for the first time in 20 months, a troubling sign.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail sales, which don\u2019t include spending on services, have been slowing since February.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor July, auto sales rose 0.4 percent after a 0.7 percent gain in June. Demand for cars has been low this year, and many dealers have also had a hard time stocking popular models because of supply chain disruptions stemming from the Japan crisis.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGasoline sales rose 1.6 percent. The increase was largely because of the rise in gas prices that have since been reversed.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPurchases of furniture rose 0.5 percent, electronics store sales increased 1.4 percent, and sales at specialty clothing stores climbed 0.5 percent.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSales at department stores fell 0.8 percent in July. Economists had expected them to show a rise following reports from big retailers that they had a decent start to the back-to-school shopping season.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSales at a broader category of general merchandise stores, which includes department stores and big retailers such as Wal-Mart, were flat in July following a 0.5 percent rise in June.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMany retailers had reported last week that back-to-school promotions had helped boost their sales in July. Target, Macy\u2019s and luxury chain Saks all reported gains that beat Wall Street expectations. But retailers are worried that consumers may be thrifty when shopping this summer, sticking with basic necessities and holding out for sales. That\u2019s a popular strategy in tighter economies, but one that hurts stores\u2019 profits.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHigh unemployment and a spike in gas prices have forced many consumers to be more cautious about spending. Their hesitation was a major reason the economy grew a meager 0.8 percent in the first six months of the year, the weakest growth since the recession officially ended.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMany economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, had thought the economic slowdown was mostly because of temporary factors, such as high gas prices and the parts shortage out of Japan.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut this week the Fed acknowledged that the economy\u2019s problems are deeper. Its statement suggested growth could be dismal for at least two more years.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a result, the Fed took the unprecedented step of pledging to keep a key interest rate it controls at a record low near zero at least through mid-2013.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivate economists have been busy marking down their own forecasts. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase said they expect the just 1.5 percent growth in the July-September quarter, a full percentage point lower than their previous forecast.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCopyright 2011 The Associated Press.

Last year, one of Ramsay\u2019s London restaurants lost a Michelin star. (Another British eatery, the Goose restaurant in Oxfordshire, has lost and found its Michelin stars three different times, which just starts to look careless.)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLast year, tech site CNET.com was forced to remove one of its stingily bestowed \u201cEditors\u2019 Choice\u201d seals from a Panasonic television when, users complained, \u201cthe black was becoming less black,\u201d says CNET Editor Scott Ard. \u201cIt was an anxiety.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Princeton Review\u2019s newest college rankings, released a few weeks ago, have brought more shock and upheaval. Bowdoin College now has only the second-tastiest campus food. The University of California at Santa Cruz slipped to No. 2 in the category \u201cReefer Madness,\u201d upended in a bold move by Colorado College. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThat was a surprise,\u201d says Rob Franek, author of the review\u2019s \u201c376 Best Colleges.\u201d Santa Cruz and Colorado \u201chave been duking it out over the past couple of years,\u201d he says, adding that the California school\u2019s mascot might have helped seal the deal. The mascot is a banana slug.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaybe everything, in the court of public dissection, has been downgraded. Here, citizens blinded by nostalgia have convinced themselves that nothing is as good as it used to be, even Julia Roberts, whom the blog Hollywood Prospectus just ranked as a Top 10 \u201cOscar Tarnisher,\u201d based on the decline of her Rotten Tomatoes rankings. In Gallup\u2019s annual \u201cConfidence in Institutions\u201d survey, which has been asking Americans how they feel about things since 1973, faith in public schools has been slowly downgraded (34 percent confidence compared with 58 in 1973), along with confidence in banks, newspapers, Congress, big business, organized religion, the U.S. Supreme Court and the presidency. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDowngrade nation!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cConfidence in things like the military has increased,\u201d Dennis Jacobe, Gallup\u2019s chief economist, says hopefully. \u201cThe police are still very high.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the downgrade still stings, because the downgrade does not represent failing, so much as it represents failing where you once succeeded, like the size 4 pants at the back of your closet. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cIt\u2019s sometimes a very tough conversation we have,\u201d says Jayne Griswold, who is in charge of working with hotels that are on the brink of downgrade for Forbes Travel Guide. Like, \u201cI respect the challenging position you might be in, but it\u2019s not working.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt\u2019s not you. It\u2019s me.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA downgrade might cause one to analyze just what led to it. Have we gotten so bad, or is it possible that expectations have simply upgraded?

Former Gov. Hugh Carey\u2019s \u201clarger than life\u201d personality was celebrated by friends, family and political acquaintances \u2014 both friends and foes \u2014 at a funeral Mass on Thursday at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. Although he is credited with leading New York out of an economic crisis as governor in the 1970s, Carey also was remembered as a World War II Army colonel who liberated concentration camps; a savvy lawmaker whose tenure on the House Ways and Means Committee prepared him for the economic challenges he would later face in Albany; and a compassionate chief executive who never turned his back on the underprivileged. The seven-term Democratic congressman, who was governor from 1975 to 1982, died Sunday at the age of 92. Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, former Gov. Mario Cuomo and his son Andrew \u2014 the current governor \u2014 U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel and former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, were joined by Republicans, including former Gov. George Pataki, former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D\u2019Amato, former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and U.S. Rep. Peter King of Long Island.  \u201cWe\u2019ve all been to too many tragic funerals,\u201d Pataki said after the service, which was attended by about 1,500 people. \u201cThis is one where we could momentarily set aside the sadness of the loss and appreciate and enjoy the wonderful life and the wonderful service of a great New Yorker.\u2019 Despite being a well-known public figure, it was Carey\u2019s large family who took center stage at the service, and in his life. One of Carey\u2019s grandchildren performed an original song, \u201cThe Ballad of the Great Hugh Carey,\u201d on a guitar, five of his children spoke of their father\u2019s lifetime of service, and 31 of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren carried communion and wine to the altar during the service.  \u201cHugh Carey was a political leader par excellence,\u201d Cardinal Edward Egan said. \u201cNever in my lifetime has this beloved nation of ours so urgently needed to learn the lessons of faithful and loving married life that Helen and Hugh quietly and powerfully taught us all.\u201d Former Gov. Cuomo called Carey \u201cthe most effective governor in our modern history.\u201d  \u201cHe, in fact, saved New York City in the \u201870s,\u201d Mario Cuomo said. \u201cWhen he saved New York City, he saved New York state. He protected the honor of the whole country. Imagine what Moscow would have said if New York City went bankrupt.\u201d Koch said he always enjoyed working with Carey. \u201cHe had a terrific sense of humor,\u201d Koch said. \u201cAnd he had a marvelous Irish tenor.\u201d Schumer said of Carey: \u201cHis family, his faith and his community were what gave him the strength to do what he did.\u201d Carey took office on Jan. 1, 1975, amid the worst economic climate since the Great Depression. New York City was nearing bankruptcy, threatening to bring the Empire State down with it. Declaring the \u201cdays of wine and roses are over,\u201d Carey took drastic action, seizing control of the city\u2019s finances, engineering more than $1 billion in state loans and mustering the backing needed to reorganize its shaky finances and restore confidence. He then won federal loan guarantees from the reluctant Republican administration of President Gerald Ford that secured the plan. Ford\u2019s hesitancy made front-page news, immortalized in the paraphrased New York Daily News headline: \u201cFord To City: Drop Dead.\u201d His daughter, Marianne Carey Hayes, said her father was willing to share credit for his accomplishments during the financial crisis. \u201cHe was always quick to point out it was due to an incredible team he put together,\u201d she said. Carey also campaigned successfully for the appointment, rather than election, of judges to the state\u2019s highest court, a move that was seen as insulating the Court of Appeals from politics. Before he became governor, Carey spent 14 years in Congress representing his Brooklyn district. Hugh Leo Carey was born in Brooklyn in 1919. He left St. John\u2019s College in 1939 and fought in the infantry in World War II with the 104th Division in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Carey and his first wife, Helen, had 14 children. Two sons died in a car accident in 1969, and Helen, who had cancer, died in 1974. His accomplishments were sometimes overshadowed by gaffes, however, such as an offer to drink a glass of toxic PCBs to downplay contamination of a state office building. His 1981 marriage to millionaire Evangeline Gouletas was troubled from the start. Carey\u2019s new bride had said she was twice married and her first husband had died; the truth was she had been married three times and all her exes were still alive. Carey and Gouletas divorced in 1989. Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But not here. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the Republican presidential candidates gear up for Saturday\u2019s critical straw poll in Ames, they are aggressively targeting a network of pastors, parents who home-school their children, evangelicals and other conservatives who care as much about stopping gay marriage as they do about the debt ceiling. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhoever gains traction with this crucial constituency in Iowa could not only win the straw poll but could galvanize religious conservatives throughout the country who remain a powerful force in Republican politics. On Thursday night, GOP contenders squared off at a debate in Ames, hoping to more sharply define their candidacies.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn 2007, with no other major candidate rallying the Christian conservative movement, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee came from behind to finish second in the straw poll. He then won the Iowa caucuses and several other primary contests by courting religious conservatives. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis time, that voting bloc has more options. Former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) is a home-schooling parent. Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.) has spoken about when she \u201cgave my heart to Jesus Christ\u201d as a 16-year-old. Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty speaks openly about his shift from Catholicism to evangelical Protestantism. Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.) is eyeing the sizable group of Huckabee backers who are strongly affiliated with the tea party movement.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd conservatives across the nation are closely watching Texas Gov. Rick Perry, an evangelical who held a massive prayer rally in Houston last week and plans to announce his candidacy Saturday. His name is not on the straw poll ballot, but his supporters are waging a write-in campaign. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThere\u2019s not the convergence this time,\u201d said Chuck Hurley, a 2008 Huckabee backer who runs the Iowa Family Policy Center. Hurley, who has not yet decided who his favorite candidate is, added, \u201cMy friends are all over the place.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWinning over these voters could catapult a fledgling campaign. Huckabee had little money in 2008, but he had energetic volunteers who made up for his fundraising gap. They organized supporters and even created campaign literature. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe former Huckabee backers say they are concerned about the growing budget deficit and President Obama\u2019s economic policies, like Republicans all over the country. Many support the aims of the tea party, and some consider themselves part of it. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut these one-time Huckabee voters are social conservatives who say a candidate must have a consistent record of limiting abortion and opposing gay marriage to get their support. Some are strongly critical of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who in the past has suggested that he supports abortion rights. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMany are highly religious. In the 2008 Iowa caucuses, only 19\u00a0percent of voters who considered themselves \u201cborn again\u201d or \u201cevangelical\u201d backed Romney, compared with 46 percent who supported Huckabee, according to entrance polling of caucus-goers by the National Election Pool. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cI\u2019m an absolute fiscal and social conservative. You cannot be a fiscal conservative if you are not a social conservative,\u201d said Julie Roe, who lives in rural Hardin County and organized for Huckabee in 2008. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe candidates spend most of their public time in Iowa giving speeches that focus on the economy and the fiscal debate in Washington. But there\u2019s a quieter campaign underway to recruit key activists who helped Huckabee win.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoe, who had never really engaged in politics before the 2008 campaign, got involved with Huckabee through fellow home-schooling families and connections at her church. Roe, who now sends her children to a private Christian school, says she has received calls from two candidates. She declined to say which ones. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLast week, she heard from a familiar voice: Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Arkansas governor\u2019s daughter, who is helping to run Pawlenty\u2019s Iowa operation. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Farris, chairman of the Virginia-based Home School Legal Defense Association, said he has received calls from nearly every candidate and Huckabee Sanders even though he doesn\u2019t live in Iowa and can\u2019t vote in the straw poll. He has close ties to the thousands of parents who home-school their children in the state, and his organization\u2019s endorsement on the eve of the 2007 straw poll helped Huckabee. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely we are going to do anything this time,\u201d before the straw poll, Farris said. \u201cThe situation is not as clear to us, with Rick Perry being the biggest issue.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMike Huckabee, who earlier this year ruled out a second presidential bid, has avoided endorsing a candidate. While his daughter is with Pawlenty, several of his key aides are with Bachmann.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlice Stewart, who was Huckabee\u2019s national press secretary and is now in the same role for Bachmann, said her candidate was making a special effort to reach key pastors in the state, just as Huckabee did four years ago. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cShe acts out her faith every day, and she naturally speaks their language,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cMichele and the governor [Huckabee] share the natural constituency of the faith community.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile lacking the formal training of a pastor like Huckabee, Bachmann has appeared in Iowa churches and spoken in detail about religion\u2019s role in her life. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cSee suffering that comes into your life as opportunity, really something that God brilliantly designs as a challenge to not only buffet you but also to strengthen you,\u201d she told a crowd at New Life Community Church in Marion, Iowa, last month in a \u201ctestimony of faith\u201d that was recorded by Radio Iowa. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwo miles from the Bachmann headquarters just outside Des Moines, Huckabee Sanders is crafting the strategy for Pawlenty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen she first joined the campaign, Huckabee Sanders appeared in a video message, released by the campaign, which quoted her saying, \u201cGovernor Pawlenty has the same conservative convictions and executive experience I admire in my dad.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut she played down the impact of her joining Pawlenty\u2019s team, arguing that the Minnesota governor\u2019s intense stumping in towns around the state and the campaign\u2019s get-out-the-vote operation were the true keys. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cThis is a very big organizational exercise,\u201d she said. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbaconp@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStaff researcher Lucy Shackelford contributed to this report.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 17:23:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsrepublican-presidential-contenders-court-former-huckabee-backers20110808giqahgtj9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 119, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 09:56:11", "created": "2011-08-11 12:25:17", "headline": "The life (and death) of a speed bump", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/rosenwald-md/post/the-life-and-death-of-a-speed-bump/2011/08/11/gIQAANSh8I_blog.html?wprss=rosenwald-md", "content": "<p>In life, things come and go.</p>\n<p>Friends.

Rumors that France would follow the United States in losing its AAA credit rating, for instance, triggered a massive sell-off in Paris on Wednesday, with negative sentiment weighing on markets Thursday before a late rally. This week, investors have dumped French bank stocks in a frenzy of selling not seen since the height of the global financial crisis in 2008. But there was one big problem. The downgrade rumor wasn\u2019t true. The three major rating agencies all confirmed France\u2019s AAA rating, adding that they had a \u201cstable outlook\u201d on French debt and no immediate intentions of lowering it. Standard & Poor\u2019s, the agency that downgraded U.S. Treasurys, went out of its way to emphasize its faith in politicians in Paris to compromise on a plan to reduce French debt.  As Giada Giani, a London-based economist with Citigroup, pointed out, S&P positively contrasted France \u201cwith the U.S., where it noted political parties are willing to sacrifice the sovereign\u2019s top rating for political purposes.\u201d   Of course, leading economists say there is very good reason for the concern, if not outright alarm, that has sent markets into wild spasms and has sparked fears of another global financial meltdown. Investors are simply waking up to a stark reality. Too many rich nations have vastly overspent while failing to find a new path to robust growth. That is particularly true in Europe, now at the core of investor concerns. There are mounting fears about the exposure of German and French banks to the troubled debt of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, as well as concerns about the large economies of Italy and Spain. If things get worse in Italy and Spain, the effect of their bad debt could ripple through the global banking system, starting with Europe\u2019s big banks, in the same manner that the collapse in U.S. subprime-mortgage-backed securities did in 2008.  More basically, investors are responding to the failure of European leaders to find the political will to fully resolve the debt crisis that started in Greece and has spread during the past 22 months. Seventeen nations, from Finland to Slovenia, have united in a common currency union, adopting the euro. But those nations have failed to link their economies in a fiscal union that, for instance, would make German and Italian taxpayers as liable for the debts of the euro zone as Californians and Virginians are for U.S. debt. This has made investors, many say, rightly nervous. But European countries \u2014 notoriously bureaucratic and far from agreement on what to do \u2014 are unlikely to move fast to more fully link their economies. So, at the very least, investors are looking for an interim promise that European leaders still refuse to make: that if things get worse in Italy and Spain, the financially stable nations, including Germany and France, will bail them out. That has contributed to the current market fear, which some say is out of proportion to the immediate risk and which has been sharply magnified by the credit-rating downgrade and worries of a slowdown in the United States.  The spread of panic to France might motivate Europe to respond faster to calm a cycle of panic that, rightly or wrongly, has become the dominant psychology of the market. \u201cMy view on France is that there are problems in the banking cycle, there are problems with how the whole sovereign debt crisis is being dealt with in Europe, and the market is showing nervousness and concern regarding the endgame,\u201d said Laurent Moulin, an economist with Geneva-based Lombard Odier Investment Managers. But, he added, \u201cI think right now we have kind of an exaggeration. I don\u2019t think the French banking system is going to go bankrupt.\u201d Analysts said concerns about French and German banks holding the bonds of Italy and Spain are based on fears that those bonds will dramatically drop in value.  Yet that would happen only if investors themselves lose faith in those bonds, dumping them in panicked selling.   \u201cPart of the problem is that countries like Italy haven\u2019t really had a sympathetic hearing from the markets,\u201d said Stephen King, chief economist with HSBC Bank in London. \u201cIf you look at some of the smaller periphery countries in trouble in Europe, they behaved rather badly in the past.

Michele Bachmann (Minn.) charmed Republicans \u2014 and rocketed to the front of a wide-open field \u2014 with an engaging and energetic performance. On Thursday, when Bachmann will appear with seven others at yet another televised debate, this one in Ames, Iowa, she must show that her candidacy has staying power. Part of Bachmann\u2019s success in June stemmed from the fact that expectations were low \u2014 and she exceeded them. Amid the widespread perception that some of her views are out of the mainstream and that her five years in Congress don\u2019t qualify her to be president of the United States, Bachmann delivered a poised and confident performance that satisfied even some in the Republican establishment that she looked presidential. Bachmann\u2019s challenge Thursday is to turn in another such performance. She has no trouble on the campaign trail firing up her supporters with her deeply conservative and uncompromising opinions about taxes, government spending and regulation. She also boasts a seemingly  endless capacity to lob perfectly sized soundbite hand grenades at President Obama, a skill that will serve her well on national television. Bachmann\u2019s challenge lies in how she will handle the questions that inevitably will be thrown her way about some of her more conservative views and controversial statements. During this summer\u2019s showdown over the nation\u2019s debt load and credit rating, Bachmann opposed raising the debt ceiling under any circumstances \u2014 a view not shared by most Americans. She and her husband, Marcus, own a counseling business in Minnesota that, according to numerous published reports, has engaged in \u201creparative therapy\u201d \u2014 helping homosexuals \u201ccure\u201d themselves of their condition. She could face questions about both topics Thursday. Bachmann also may have to navigate questions about her religious faith, which figures enormously in her campaign speeches. Bachmann\u2019s deeply conservative Christian faith resonates with many Republican voters, but, again, it has the potential to alienate mainstream Republicans who are looking for a presidential candidate to focus on the nation\u2019s fiscal matters.  Bachmann, chairwoman of the House Tea Party Caucus, is hugely popular with tea party activists across the country. But too much emphasis on social issues \u2014 Bachmann is ardently opposed to abortion rights and same-sex marriage \u2014 also could alienate tea party leaders who want the political conversation to focus equally on fiscal matters.  Ultimately, Bachmann\u2019s challenge Thursday is to continue to  energize the conservative base that has already responded so well to her, while also demonstrating to Republican leaders that she has the gravitas and discipline to stick to the fiscal issues that are expected to matter most in the 2012 election.

Yet another option had its debut Thursday in Maryland when the state\u2019s 511 system became operational.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow you can dial those digits to find out what\u2019s going on. Although Maryland State Highway Administration officials would prefer that you call to check the roads before getting behind the wheel, they recognize that you will often do it while driving, so the system is based on a series of voice-activated prompts: You can get the answers you need without fiddling with the buttons on your phone.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSimply say \u201cCapital Beltway\u201d or \u201cBaltimore-Washington Parkway\u201d to get the latest traffic information on those roads.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe federally funded 511 program has been spreading across the country. Virginia expanded it statewide in 2005. The District and Delaware have yet to get on board.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe system offers real-time traffic information collected by Inrix, a commercial data hub that uses a system of transponders aboard fleet vehicles, such as UPS trucks. The 511 system also provides weather, transit and tourism information, and it can connect users to other services, such as Metro and \u00adE-ZPass.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a region that registers each year as one of the most congested in the nation, drivers have learned to take advantage of every option to beat the traffic.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cIf you\u2019re at the mall and you\u2019re planning your trip home and you know it\u2019s rush hour, you can call and get information,\u201d said Glenn McLaughlin, deputy director for systems at the SHA. \u201cIt\u2019s a great resource in real time to help people know the impact an incident may be having.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe new system can be customized by those who register on the md511.org Web site. Users can then enter their regular routes into the system; for example, \u201chome to work\u201d or \u201cBethesda to Ocean City.\u201d Enter a mobile phone number and then anytime someone calls in from that number, the system will ask whether the caller wants information on the specified routes.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUsers also can designate traffic cameras they want to monitor, which are accessible via a mobile Web site, md511.mobi. The system offers users partial access to a network of 542 cameras, including those operated by the SHA and others to which they have access (the functionality will depend on the smartphone).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSHA officials point out that holding a cellphone while driving is illegal in Maryland, so use of the camera feature on the road should be delegated to passengers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe system doesn\u2019t cover every roadway in Maryland, only the significant ones. The Inrix data on which the system relies quickly get fuzzy on less-traveled roads because there is insufficient feedback from the transponders. Maryland\u2019s system does include some basic information on Northern Virginia.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe system divides the state into four regions \u2014 Western Maryland, the Eastern Shore, the Baltimore area and the Washington-centric counties south of Baltimore. It automatically knows which one you\u2019re calling from, either from the first three digits of a land-line phone or the cellphone tower transmitting a mobile call.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Maryland 511 system already is on Twitter, and Facebook access is in the offing.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thalseya@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 17:51:17", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocalcommutingwhats-the-511-md-tries-to-answer20110811giqa5mlh9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 224, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 11:31:43", "created": "2011-08-12 11:30:10", "headline": "Confederate soldier\u2019s diaries find a home at Washington and Lee University", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/confederate-soldiers-diaries-find-a-home-at-washington-and-lee-university/2011/08/11/gIQAteod9I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tCivil War buffs have read plenty about the derring-do of Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson. But they haven\u2019t read this account, written in summer 1861 after the little-known Battle of Hainesville:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe sat calmly on his horse & wrote a dispatch to Gen. Johnston, whilst the balls were flying thick around him, knocking up the dust, cutting down leaves from the trees &c.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThey are the words of Alexander Sterrett Paxton, a Virginia college student who joined the Confederate infantry and served in Jackson\u2019s storied Stonewall Brigade.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaxton\u2019s diaries \u2014 six of them, chronicling the conflict from beginning to end \u2014 surfaced at auction this summer. A group of donors raised the funds to purchase them for Washington and Lee University, where Paxton was a senior when the war erupted. Paxton marched off to fight with about 100 classmates, known to posterity as the Liberty Hall Volunteers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe diaries, previously unknown, add a new and articulate voice to the corpus of first-hand accounts of the war. They are a welcome addition to the Special Collections library at Washington and Lee, a quintessentially Virginian university, where Robert E. Lee once served as president.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe just knew that this was where these diaries needed to be,\u201d said David Klinestiver, an Indianapolis attorney and Civil War enthusiast who belongs to a group that reenacts battles fought by the Liberty Hall Volunteers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaxton grew up near Lexington and enrolled at the institution then known as Washington College, after George Washington, a key early donor. When Virginia seceded, students raised a Confederate flag. That drew a protest from President George Junkin, a Union loyalist. Faculty sided with the students, and Junkin fled.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese were men \u201cof the age that they would have been caught up in the furor and the rage of what was going on around them,\u201d said C.J. Roberts, a historian and fellow Civil War reenactor.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMany of the students knew Jackson personally: He was a fellow Lexingtonian and had held a teaching post at the neighboring Virginia Military Institute. So, in June 1861, they left in wagons and stagecoaches to meet up with the general in Winchester.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaxton began his account with this legend: Devoted to a brief history of the adventures, movements &c of the \u2018Liberty Hall Volunteers\u2019 during the war of Southern Independence & of resistance to Northern Despotism.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe wrote that he had joined the conflict because the peace & safety of our homes in the Old Dominion were threatened by the warlike preparations of Old Abe Lincoln.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA month later, the young infantryman found himself in the First Battle of Bull Run, on the battlefield where Jackson earned his nickname.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe wrote: The shells would burst over & around us scattering their fragments far & wide. And as we lay there prostrated on the ground the cannon balls from the enemy\u2019s guns would whiz just a few feet above our bodies, strike in front of our line & bounce over us, whilst the minie balls went singing by our ears & between our bodies.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaxton penciled a sketch of the battlefield. And he gave this account of Jackson:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhilst we were there Gen Jackson rode up & down the line as cool & calm as if on an evening parade, tho\u2019 the missiles of destruction flew around him as thick as hail. Now & then he would exclaim \u201cAlls well,\u201d & remarked \u201cThis night we will drive them across the Potomac.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the conflict wore on, Paxton remarked on the hardening of his own nature: Nothing is so exciting as to get a shot at a Yankee. How strange that the better & kinder feelings of our natures should be thus changed!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn May 1863, he described being wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville: Just as I fired my last shot, I was shot through the right leg about two inches above the knee. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaxton went home to recuperate. He returned that fall and fought with the Confederates till Lee\u2019s surrender in April 1865, when he observed, The very atmosphere breathes of bad news.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe diaries remained in private hands until June, when Paxton\u2019s descendants put them up for auction. The Washington and Lee library lacked the funds to raise the purchase price, so Roberts and Klinestiver organized a group of 11 donors, including several alumni. They bought the diaries for about $21,000 on June 23 and delivered them to the Lexington campus July 22.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cOur alumni rose to the occasion rather marvelously,\u201d said Vaughan Stanley, special collections librarian at the university. He also praised the reenactors who contributed.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome of the six volumes are store-bought pocket journals. Later on, as supplies dwindled, Paxton resorted to binding pages by hand, using scraps of discarded military forms and bits of leather and string.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEarly entries are lengthy and detailed. Later entries are fewer and plainer, some of them \u201cclearly written in haste,\u201d Klinestiver said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaxton returned home after the war. He eventually became principal of a girl\u2019s school in Kentucky and wrote a long-forgotten memoir of antebellum memories. He was, by all accounts, a Confederate patriot to the end.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead more: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCivil War blog: A House Divided\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWilson\u2019s Creek reenactment to draw thousands this weekend\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCivil War statue dedicated 100 years late\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdevised@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 16:56:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaleducationconfederate-soldiers-diaries-find-a-home-at-washington-and-lee-university20110811giqateod9i_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 127, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 13:26:10", "headline": "Gingrich has a lot at stake in tonight\u2019s debate", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gingrich-has-a-lot-at-stake-in-tonights-debate/2011/08/11/gIQAWp6i8I_story.html?wprss=rss_politics", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tThe former House speaker needs to reclaim his status as a legitimate 2012 presidential candidate.

The Obama administration counters that Congress\u2019 power to regulate interstate commerce squares the constitutionality of the mandate.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRothenberg said ProgressOhio was hindered from fully reviewing all the submitted petitions because 40 percent of Ohio counties refused to respond to a public records request in the time allotted for review.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cOhioans will now have a choice \u2014 to return to the days when children were denied insurance coverage over pre-existing conditions; return to the days when seniors have to choose between prescription drugs and groceries; return to the days when young adults can\u2019t stay on their parents insurance and return to the days when small businesses did not get tax breaks for providing insurance,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis fall \u2018no\u2019 will be a beautiful word.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCopyright 2011 The Associated Press.

But, most importantly, it shines a spotlight on Butler and the defunct American Bantam Car Co., which has made the city of nearly 14,000 residents almost famous.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cIt\u2019s not what you would call an invention like a light bulb. It\u2019s a design,\u201d said Bill Spear, an Alaska Jeep enthusiast and expert on American Bantam\u2019s history. \u201cBut, that being said, it\u2019s one of the most enduring and original designs in automotive history.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe thumbnail version of the story is that American Bantam was one of just two companies \u2014 out of 135 manufacturers solicited \u2014 to bid on a contract to produce a new lightweight, all-terrain vehicle as top federal and military officials quietly prepared in 1940 for the United States to go to war.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWillys-Overland is often credited with inventing the Jeep because it emerged from the war with the rights to the vehicle\u2019s design and trademarked the name soon afterward. Willys was also the only other manufacturer to submit a bid, but it couldn\u2019t meet the government\u2019s 49-day deadline to build a prototype. Only Bantam did that.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd yet \u2014 possibly due to favoritism, New Deal politics, or bureaucratic infighting \u2014 Bantam was pushed to the sidelines. A congressional inquiry into how that happened was trumped by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, as Willys and Ford won government contracts and made history, producing nearly all of the nearly 650,000 Jeeps used in the war. Bantam would survive by making military trailers, torpedo motors and aircraft landing gear, before the company was bought out by what was then Armco Steel in 1956.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cIt was a whole convoluted year of infighting over who would produce the first Jeep,\u201d Spear said. \u201cSome of the greatest names of the era were involved and they\u2019re all at cross-purposes and trying to take credit. It was like throwing a bunch of meat in a shark pool.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe locals bristle at the oft-repeated history that American Bantam was passed over in favor of the larger auto makers because the company was in financial trouble and thought not to be able to deliver a big order. Spear said the factory had the capacity to produce 150 to 300 vehicles a day \u2014 more than sufficient to meet military demands \u2014 but lost control of its design to the military, which then gave Willys and, eventually, Ford, extra time to come up with similar prototypes after Army experts realized their original hopes for a 1,200-pound vehicle (light enough for soldiers to pull out of the mud) wasn\u2019t practical.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWillys would merge with Kaiser Motors in the 1950s, and later be purchased by American Motors Corp. before Chrysler bought AMC in the 1980s, largely to get its hands on the Jeep line. Chrysler\u2019s official \u201cJeep History\u201d credits Bantam with creating the earliest prototype in the three-way competition, but says a version known as the Willys Quad \u201cwith modifications and improvements\u201d was the vehicle that became the Jeep.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cThere is no more real dispute between any of the corporations,\u201d said Jay Margolies, the president and owner of Willys-Overland Motors, of Toledo, Ohio. \u201cBut there is a dispute among aficionados and they\u2019ll go on forever about it. They even argue about how to pronounce Willys,\u201d Margolies said, with some preferring something akin to \u201cWillis.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMargolies, who owns the Willys name pronounces it WIL\u2019-ees, specializes in Jeep replacement parts but his company is not otherwise in the lineage or affiliated with the original firm.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeep fanatics even debate the origin of the name. Chrysler doesn\u2019t take sides, noting only that some believe it resulted from the slurred pronunciation of the letters \u201cGP,\u201d the government\u2019s designation for \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d vehicle, while others insist enamored GIs named it after a character in the Popeye comic strip. Eugene the Jeep, the sailor\u2019s jungle pet, was known for its ability to maneuver out of tough situations.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhatever the case, generations of drivers still love Jeeps \u2014 especially those from the 1940s \u2014 and have come to Butler to profess it.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBill Ringeisen, 55, of Evans City, owns five Jeeps, including a 1942 Ford GPW that he\u2019s restored to WWII specs since rescuing it 15 years ago from a Pittsburgh chicken coop where it was rusting away.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cWhen you re-do a World War II vehicle, you don\u2019t want it perfect like a (restored) Corvette or a Camaro,\u201d Ringeisen said. Imperfections were common as the vehicles were hastily manufactured and, often, cannibalized and rebuilt during the war with parts swapped between Willys and Ford models.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat doesn\u2019t mean details don\u2019t matter: Ringeisen belongs to a group called the Flat Fender Club, so-named for those who prefer models before Willys began rounding the fenders in the 1950s.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe organizers of the Jeep Festival are content as long as people include Butler\u2019s role in any conversation about Jeep history.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJack Cohen, president of Butler County Tourism and Convention Bureau, came up with the festival idea after he bought a Jeep and noticed Jeep owners have a kinship similar to that of Harley Davidson motorcycle owners.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cEverywhere I go there\u2019s kind of a Harley following. And everybody that I know who are Jeepers are the same way, and I thought, \u2018My gosh, we\u2019re missing an opportunity to talk about this history in Butler,\u201d Cohen said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCohen\u2019s group and the city are currently in negotiations with AK Steel Co. (Armco Steel\u2019s successor) to obtain the vacant American Bantam plant. Eventually, they\u2019d like to convert part of it to a Bantam Jeep history center, while perhaps using the rest as an incubator for innovative businesses.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe drama of the Jeep story doesn\u2019t hurt, said Patti Jo Lambert, the festival\u2019s spokeswoman.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cFor somebody who really wants to learn about the history of how the Jeep began, there\u2019s a lot of twists and turns,\u201d Lambert said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCopyright 2011 The Associated Press.

British publications were quick to blame social networks, such as Facebook, Google+, and Twitter for fueling the riots. But private Blackberry messaging \u2014 not Twitter \u2014 was the most popular medium through which rioters communicated. This is important because social media technologies include more than just text messages and tweets. Each technology could impact the shape of a protest or riot in a different way. But most importantly, over-generalizing social media\u2019s role could do more to harm our understanding of an uprising than help it.  I understand the situation in London is evolving, and that the political and cultural environment dramatically differs from that within North Africa and the Middle East\u2019s \u201cArab Spring.\u201d But I remain curious as to why, just like the \u201cArab Spring,\u201d so much attention is placed on social media in this protest. My recent research has focused on tracing the paths and voices of Egyptian citizens and activists, trying to answer the question of how and to what extent social media has shaped the political landscape in the Arab world\u2019s most populous country. My time there convinces me that neither social media technologies nor the youth that use them are the main driver of the masses that overtook the streets of many cities in Egypt from January 25th onward. Revolutions and riots pre-date social media. Deep unrest, a history of oppositional organizing, economic downturns, corruption, and the relatively neutral position of the military are all factors that have impacted Egypt. These far more dramatically shape the realities experienced in a country with 85 million people, under 5 percent of whom use Facebook and 1 percent use Twitter. While activists and younger, wealthier, and educated citizens may connect with one another and build strong ties via these technologies, legitimate grievances and community organizing more directly played a role in mobilizing the masses. Confronting these grievances by cutting off or hacking a communication technology, as one British lawmaker said should be done to Blackberry in London, fails to address the deep-rooted dissatisfaction that drove people to take to the streets. The Egypt case shows that when a regime cuts Internet, television, and mobile phone networks, protester numbers may actually increase. Yet it is equally shortsighted to dismiss the power of YouTube videos, Tweets, Facebook groups, and mobile phones in shaping journalism, communication between activists, and on-the-ground mobile communication. When people act out they naturally use available media and, in the case of London, these would include technologies like Blackberry messaging. While in Egypt, fewer protesters directly engaged with these technologies, but they still influenced journalism and the direct communication patterns of a select few. For example, different groups sharing common grievances can \u201clike\u201d each others\u2019 Facebook pages and merge memberships without confronting emergency laws. Opinions and tactics introduced via Twitter can be rapidly re-tweeted and sourced as stories by domestic and international journalists. Activists can share tips and techniques with one another, and co-organize. Tunisian Mohamed Bouazizi can immolate himself in protest of a corrupt regime and impact both his own people as well as neighbors in Egypt \u2014 thanks to the ways in which video was captured and transmitted via mobile phones before being picked up by non-State-run television channels. Social media are part of a much larger matrix of tools and intentions that rally masses. That said, they are neither necessary nor sufficient to make a revolution possible. By fixating on technologies and the few youth that actively use them, we ignore a much more powerful narrative \u2014 the story of how synergies are created between classes to mobilize as a network without depending on social media. In Egypt, these networks may include family connections, neighborhoods, mosques, and historical institutions, such as the previously banned Muslim Brotherhood. New technologies hardly erode or overwhelm these classic models of communication and information sharing. The story of Egypt presents an example of how a shared desire to end a corrupt regime can bring together peoples from all walks of life. And learning from Egypt allows us to understand how complex networks form, sustain, and present possibilities for people to collectively imagine and take hold of their political and economic futures.  In light of this, let\u2019s avoid making the same mistake in London.  By being so quick to blame social media for political and social unrest, we ignore the powerful economic and political grievances that drive discontent. With or without these technologies, people will ultimately stand up and speak their minds. If we continue to focus on technologies rather than peoples, we risk ignoring the source of their grievances and the more complex, organic networks by which they choose to communicate.

In particular, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty was in overdrive to draw supporters to the event and turn around a campaign that has struggled to raise money and gain traction in the polls.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy all accounts, the outcome of the straw poll remained up for grabs in an uncertain and still-growing field of candidates, with Pawlenty, fellow Minnesotan Rep. Michele Bachmann and Texas Rep. Ron Paul all in position to perform well after weeks building support across the state.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cIt\u2019s probably as unpredictable a straw poll as we have had,\u201d said Matt Strawn, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. \u201cI think some of that goes to the fluidity of the race and the late-developing nature and the notion that most Iowa caucusgoers are still at the dating phase of the caucus process. They perhaps haven\u2019t married the candidate they will see all the way through the caucus.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA win for Pawlenty could give him the momentum he needs, while a loss, depending on its severity, could doom his ability to draw crucial donors heading into the fall. Bachmann hopes to show that she can sustain her catapult to the top of the standings in Iowa since declaring her candidacy in June. Less clear are the consequences of a victory for Paul, whose libertarian and isolationist views attract intense support from a narrow band of Republican voters but are not in step with the mainstream of the GOP.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdding uncertainty to the significance of the straw poll was the list of candidates not competing in it. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is expected to announce his candidacy Saturday morning, and former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, who will visit the state fair Friday, will not appear on the straw poll ballot. Palin\u2019s presidential plans remain unknown, but Perry\u2019s widely anticipated announcement could prompt a write-in campaign on his behalf at the straw poll.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSimilarly, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney will not participate in the poll, but his standing as the presumed national front-runner could attract significant support. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoor showings by candidates lower down in the standings, including former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum and businessman Herman Cain, could begin the process of winnowing the Republican field as the presidential campaign heads into the fall.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe carnival-like nature of the straw poll, which serves largely as a fundraiser for the state Republican Party, has long been criticized as an uncertain and even irrelevant data point in the long march toward the Republican nomination. On the grounds of Iowa State University in Ames, candidates will host passersby in tents that are positioned and sized according to how much they paid. They will ply supporters with free tickets, free shuttle rides and free barbecue. They will give speeches, and they will pray that their efforts will pay off with the few thousand votes it will take \u2014 a sliver of the overall electorate \u2014 to win the contest late Saturday afternoon.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor weeks, Pawlenty has focused like a laser on winning the straw poll, crisscrossing Iowa with scores of stops and collecting hundreds of names, numbers and e-mail addresses to draw supporters to Ames. Even on Thursday, in the moments before Fox News started its broadcast of the debate, a dozen or so volunteers at his Iowa headquarters in Urbandale were working the phones, calling those names and explaining in persistent detail just how easy and fun it would be to swing by Ames on Saturday and cast their vote.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cI can give you so many options!\u201d one volunteer said enthusiastically into his cellphone, pacing the carpeted office. \u201cWe have a bus leaving Wal-Mart. We have a shuttle running all day long between Ankeny and Ames. It\u2019s going to start at 9 o\u2019clock and run all day back and forth. So you can park anytime at the middle school and then you can get on the shuttle and come back when you want and you\u2019re done. Is that something you\u2019d like to do?\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPawlenty\u2019s organizational firepower goes up against the more dramatic energy that both Bachmann and Paul have drawn from supporters on the trail. Both candidates have consistently drawn bigger crowds and more passion at their campaign events, and both operations have been working intensely in recent weeks \u2014 albeit not as long as Pawlenty \u2014 to secure voters willing to make the trek to Ames.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaul paid $31,000 for the prime tent spot just outside the Hilton Coliseum where voting will take place \u2014 the same spot Romney purchased four years ago before going on to win the poll. And to encourage voter loyalty, Paul\u2019s campaign has taken to help pay \u2014 but not fully pay  \u2014 the $30 straw poll ticket price. While other campaigns are paying the full freight, the idea is that a voter who chips in $10 is more likely to show up and vote for Paul.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cSince 2007 he\u2019s picked up a lot more support, a lot more supporters,\u201d Paul spokesman Gary Howard said. \u201cWe\u2019ve picked up a number of volunteers because a lot more people know him and support him. Last time around, there was no tea party.

That changed suddenly Thursday night during a raucous debate that produced the sharpest exchanges of the campaign and signaled a new and more intense phase in the nomination battle.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThursday\u2019s two-hour debate bore almost no resemblance to a similar gathering in New Hampshire two months ago. If that was an example of timid candidates on good behavior, this was a case of nearly everyone needing to prove something and fearing they had little time to prove it.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMinnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty clashed repeatedly over each other\u2019s records and qualifications. Pawlenty, not wanting to make the mistake he made in New Hampshire, challenged former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney over health care.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut others sought to leave a mark as well. Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum sparred with Texas Rep. Ron Paul over foreign policy. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich chastised moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News for asking about his struggling campaign. Former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr. sought to reinsert himself into the race after a shaky summer. Businessman Herman Cain hoped to erase memories of his weak performance in the earlier debate.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf this debate did not fundamentally change the shape of the race, it underscored that all of the candidates sense that change is coming \u2014 and they are anxious not to be left behind as the race heads into the fall.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe politicians debated at a crucial moment in the Republican race, with Texas Gov. Rick Perry ready to join the campaign with a bid that many strategists believe will pose an immediate threat to Romney\u2019s front-running status. And Saturday\u2019s Iowa straw poll could effectively knock out some candidates.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo one had more on the line than Pawlenty and Bachmann, who are on a collision course in the straw poll. The two have been sparring by long distance ever since the Minnesota congressman zoomed past the former governor in national and Iowa polls, and their disagreements boiled over Thursday in a series of tense exchanges.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPawlenty played the role of aggressor, arguing that Bachmann\u2019s record of accomplishment in Congress was \u201cnonexistent.\u201d But Bachmann more than held her ground, accusing Pawlenty of a series of policy positions as governor that made him seem more like President Obama than a conservative Republican.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom there, the rhetorical battle escalated, or perhaps descended, into sharper and sharper lines of attack that made palpable the apparent dislike between the two. \u201cShe said she\u2019s got a titanium spine. It\u2019s not her spine we\u2019re worried about. It\u2019s her record of results. If that\u2019s your view of effective leadership with results, please stop, because you\u2019re killing us,\u201d he said, drawing an audible response from the audience.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdvisers to both candidates seemed pleased by the exchanges.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThose clashes, and the voluble exchanges between Paul and Santorum soaked up time and energy on the stage, with the result that Romney once again came out of the debate relatively unscathed. It was the second time that the frontrunner was mostly able to deliver his message on the economy, this time content to watch the fireworks around him. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut he did not emerge totally unscathed. Challenged on health care and his support for an individual mandate similar to that in the legislation signed by Obama last year, Romney parried with a defense that cited his support for the 10th Amendment and the power of states to make their own decisions. But Bachmann too jumped in, signaling what many Republicans have long predicted, that the issue could continue to dog Romney throughout the nomination battle.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaul was a forceful presence on the stage, delivering his antiwar message with passion. He could be a spoiler Saturday, though a value of a surprise first-place straw poll finish likely is questionable. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSantorum, who at times seemed to disappear as others dominated the debate, is also at risk on Saturday and repeatedly was at pains to draw attention to himself and his morality-based campaign message.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore than anyone, Gingrich came alive on Thursday. The former speaker displayed the same brash style that marked his tenure as House GOP leader, and he clearly had the audience on his side when he took on his questioner. But it wasn\u2019t clear how he might translate that into broader support from Republican voters.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHuntsman, making his debate debut, tried to tout himself as a business-friendly former chief executive and an authority on foreign policy. But he, too, had to work to make himself a central player, given the theatrics elsewhere on stage.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy the end of the month, much more will be known about the shape of the Republican race. But Thursday\u2019s debate offered a preview of what is to come. With the stakes growing and the cast of characters changing, the Republicans face what could be a fierce battle for the nomination \u2014 one that will look far different than the campaign so far.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbalzd@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 21:32:46", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsgop-debate-kicks-campaign-into-new-phase20110811giqadyo29i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 242, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 14:04:15", "created": "2011-08-12 14:04:15", "headline": "Byron York defends \u2018submissive\u2019 Bachmann question", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/byron-york-defends-submissive-bachmann-question/2011/08/12/gIQAyXw8AJ_blog.html?wprss=the-fix", "content": "<p>Rep. <b>Michele Bachmann</b> (R-Minn.) took a lot of hits at Thursday night\u2019s Fox News debate from her 2012 rivals.

Carter is ecstatic and \u201clooking forward to getting back into the world of journalism and political discussion,\u201d said his lawyer Julia Kuan. The 46-year-old Carter was convicted in 2009 of attempted assault after his wife, Marilyn, told police he hit her. She recanted before trial, but Ramapo Town Judge Arnold Etelson called her story \u201cpreposterous.\u201d He also called Carter \u201ca classic case of a domestic violence abuser.\u201d Carter, who served 19 days in jail, had taken a leave from NY1 when the charges were made public. The station cut ties with him just before he was sentenced. His nightly \u201cInside City Hall\u201d program was a mainstay for city politics junkies, and he had interviewed every major New York City and state politician. He returned to TV last month as a regular guest on RNN-TV, a regional cable news outlet, Kuan said. The Appellate Division in Brooklyn reversed the conviction this week without getting into the circumstances of the case, saying Carter should never have been tried. It said the judge originally ordered an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, which would have resulted in dismissal of charges if Carter stayed out of trouble for a year. The appeals court said the judge should have denied a later prosecution request to go to trial. Rockland County District Attorney Thomas Zugibe said prosecutors were exploring an appeal.  \u201cIt is important to note that the appeals court did not rule on (Carter\u2019s) culpability and did not base its decision on the merits of the charge or the sufficiency of the evidence,\u201d the district attorney said in a statement. The trial judge had ordered Carter, of Pomona, to say away from his wife for up to two years.  \u201cMrs. Carter, your life is at stake,\u201d he said. Kuan said the judge modified the order of protection after Carter got out of jail, and the couple, now married 25 years, is still together. They have a daughter in her early 20s and a teenage son. Kuan said the case \u201chas had a huge effect on him. ...

Gigi Jordan was found incoherent in a pill-strewn room with her dead son, Jude Mirra, in February 2010. She says she felt justified in killing Jude and trying to kill herself to save them both from people she feared were after them. After about a year and a half behind bars awaiting trial, Jordan modeled her bid for freedom on the conditions that got the International Monetary Fund leader released for a time to home confinement in his unrelated sexual assault case: $6 million in bail, armed guards and electronic monitoring. Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Charles Solomon noted that he had turned down a $5 million bond and house arrest proposal from Jordan last year. At the time, he cited factors including her roughly $40 million fortune and apparent psychological problems.  \u201cThe court still feels that the setting of bail is inappropriate in this case,\u201d Solomon said in a ruling Thursday. And as for the parallel the 50-year-old Jordan drew to Strauss-Kahn, \u201cwhat another justice does in a case involving very different charges, completely different circumstances and a different defendant has no bearing on this court\u2019s decision,\u201d Solomon wrote. Strauss-Kahn, who denies charges of trying to rape a hotel maid, was eventually released without bail after about six weeks on house arrest. Jordan\u2019s lawyers said they planned to challenge the bail denial. Among other things, they argue the judge didn\u2019t give enough consideration to jail psychiatric reports indicating that Jordan\u2019s mental state has improved. At this point, \u201cshe\u2019s on less medication than the average Manhattan professional,\u201d said lawyer Ronald Kuby, who is representing Jordan with Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz. Manhattan prosecutors have previously called Jude\u2019s killing calculated and premeditated, and they\u2019ve questioned the sincerity of the suicide attempt by Jordan, who made a fortune in the pharmaceuticals business before leaving it to care for her son. Jordan, in a bail application so extensive it filled a plastic storage tub, says she felt she and her son faced such danger that she should take both their lives to spare him from suffering. Jude had been tortured and abused by adults close to him, authorities rebuffed her pleas to investigate and a person in her and her son\u2019s lives had defrauded and manipulated her, she says. Ultimately, she says, she became worried she would be killed or institutionalized so that person could get control of Jude and her money. She\u2019s planning to build a novel defense around the behavioral concept of altruistic filicide \u2014 child killing by parents who believe they\u2019re acting in the child\u2019s best interests. The case has been muddied by the disappearance of the only sample of Jordan\u2019s blood taken shortly after her arrest: a sample that could help or hurt her claim of having tried to kill herself, though her lawyers pointed to other signs of a suicide attempt, including her physical condition when found and a computerized note she left. Amid debate between defense lawyers and prosecutors over procedures for testing the small blood sample for various prescription drugs, it was never tested before getting lost at the hospital where it was stored, prosecutors said last month. Jordan\u2019s lawyers filed papers Thursday seeking more information from prosecutors about the sample\u2019s disappearance. ___ Jennifer Peltz can be reached at http://twitter.com/jennpeltz Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

Layoffs are easing in most states, and some economists are predicting mild improvement in job growth. The brighter outlook was enough to catapult stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 423 points. Broader indexes also ended the day higher. Weekly unemployment applications fell to a seasonally adjusted 395,000, the Labor Department said. They had been above 400,000 for the previous 17 weeks. The four-week average, a less volatile figure, fell to 405,000. That\u2019s the lowest level since mid-April. Steven Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics, said the declining trend in applications is an encouraging sign for the job market.  \u201cAlthough the labor market also hit a \u2018soft patch\u2019 along with most of the rest of the economy during the spring and early summer, it now appears to be strengthening, at least a little, again,\u201d Wood wrote in a research note. Still, analysts responded with some caution. Applications would have to fall below 375,000 to signal healthy job growth, a level not seen since February. And other data show the economy is struggling to grow. The latest evidence of a slowdown came Thursday in a government report that the U.S. trade deficit grew in June to its widest point since October 2008. The reason was that exports fell the most in more than two years. The report will likely lead the government later this month to lower its estimate of 1.3 percent annual growth for the April-June quarter. Gregory Daco, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said he expects the estimate will be closer to 1 percent. A decline in exports follows recent reports showing consumers trimmed spending in June for the first time in nearly two years, manufacturers and service companies are struggling to grow, and the unemployment rate remains high at 9.1 percent. The Federal Reserve warned this week that the U.S. economy could be in for two years of weak growth. A dimmer outlook in the U.S. and growing worries Europe may not be able to contain its debt crisis have shaken global markets. The Dow has lost nearly 1,600 points, or more than 12 percent, since July 22. Some analysts worry that market turmoil could spook investors and consumers, causing them to take fewer risks and cut back further on spending. That would stunt economic growth at a critical time. Businesses might decide to delay hiring plans.  \u201cThe recent plunge in stock prices could discourage business investment and hiring in coming months,\u201d said Ryan Wang, an economist at HSBC Securities. \u201cIf it does, then initial claims may reverse the recent improvement. Nevertheless, for the moment, the data suggest that the economy entered the third quarter on a more positive note after the unexpected second quarter slowdown.\u201d The economy added 117,000 jobs in July, the government said last week. That was an improvement from the previous two months. But it\u2019s far below the average of 215,000 jobs per month that companies created from February through April. Many employers pulled back on hiring after signs emerged that the economy had weakened from last year. High gas prices and scant wage gains left consumers with less money to spend on discretionary purchases, such as appliances, furniture and electronics. Supply chain disruptions caused by the Japan crisis also dampened U.S. factory production. There were fewer layoffs last week in the manufacturing, transportation and service industries, according to the weekly unemployment applications report. Only nine states reported an increase in applications. Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said the decline in unemployment benefit applications shows the job market is at least not getting worse.  \u201cOf course, it tells us nothing about hiring, which the market turmoil of recent weeks will not have helped,\u201d Dales said. The number of people who are continuing to receive unemployment benefits fell 60,000 to 3.69 million. But that doesn\u2019t include nearly 4 million additional unemployed people who are receiving extended benefits under emergency programs set up during the recession. In all, about 7.5 million people received unemployment benefits in the week ending July 23, according to the latest data available. ___ AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report.

Yet even as leaders finished naming the bipartisan panel\u2019s members, it remained uncertain that it will ultimately agree on a savings plan. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the panel\u2019s final three members on Thursday, and like the previous nine all are congressional veterans. They are Reps. James E. Clyburn of South Carolina and Xavier Becerra of California, members of their party\u2019s House leadership, and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, top Democrat on the Budget Committee. Last week\u2019s agreement between President Barack Obama and Congress creating the panel gives it until Nov. 23 to propose $1.5 trillion in savings over the coming decade. If the committee fails to agree on a plan \u2014 or if Congress doesn\u2019t approve one by Dec. 23 \u2014 automatic spending cuts would be triggered affecting hundreds of federal programs. As if that weren\u2019t enough pressure, recent days have seen world financial markets endure breath-taking ups and downs, plus the downgrade of the nation\u2019s credit rating by Standard and Poor\u2019s and continued fears of economic weakness in the U.S. and Europe. In a conference call with reporters, Clyburn said he believes the panel can produce more than $1.5 trillion in savings, as long as Republicans drop their objections to raising revenues.  \u201cI think the moment we can get some of our Republican friends to stop interpreting closing loopholes as raising taxes, we\u2019ll get home free on this,\u201d Clyburn said. Underscoring the political tensions involved, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said it is time for Obama \u201cto outline his own recommendations to rein in the massive deficits and debt that are undermining job creation in our country.\u201d With next year\u2019s presidential and congressional elections looming ever closer, there have been no indications that the two parties will back down on their bedrock demands: Democrats unwilling to accept cuts in Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits, and Republicans refusing to allow tax increases. That deadlock has shoved huge potential savings off the table for bargainers. That same stalemate prevented Obama and Congress from going beyond the roughly $2 trillion in debt reduction that last week\u2019s deal yielded, an amount budget analysts consider half or less of what is needed to begin taming the red ink. All 12 members of the supercommittee \u2014 evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans \u2014 are long-time Washington politicians who seem likely to hew to party priorities.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with really tough issues in which the public will have to give up something, the main impetus for acting is when the pain of not acting is greater than the pain of acting,\u201d said Eugene Steuerle, a former Treasury Department official who now studies budget issues for the nonpartisan Urban Institute. Steuerle said that so far, it\u2019s unclear whether the public would hold the supercommittee \u2014 and by extension, Congress \u2014 accountable should they fail to broker a deal. Steve Bell, an economic analyst at the centrist Bipartisan Policy Center and former top GOP Senate aide, said members of the panel might decide they would be blamed if inaction by the supercommittee was followed by another deep recession.  \u201cDo you want to be known as one of the 12 who set in motion another financial crisis?\u201d he said. Pelosi\u2019s choices brought racial diversity to the supercommittee, since Clyburn is black and Becerra is Hispanic. The panel\u2019s co-chairs will be conservative Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, part of the House GOP leadership, and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who heads the Senate Democratic campaign arm and will be the supercommittee\u2019s only woman. Other Republicans on the panel are House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton, two long-time Michigan lawmakers; Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, a conservative and confidante of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; GOP Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, a House veteran who joined the Senate last year with tea party backing; and fellow freshman Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, a former House member and budget director for President George W. Bush. The other Democrats are 2004 Democratic presidential nominee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, D-Mass., and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., a moderate who strayed to back Bush\u2019s 2001 tax cuts. In an AP interview, Baucus predicted the committee would be successful.  \u201cThe situation is more dire,\u201d Baucus said. \u201cMore people are saying, \u2018Hey, guys and gals, get it together up there.\u2019 All of this is adding a lot more pressure and making it more likely we reach an agreement.\u201d Four supercommittee members \u2014 Baucus, Becerra, Camp and Hensarling \u2014 were members of a White House commission that recommended trillions in budget savings last year. All voted against the commission\u2019s recommendations, which have not been implemented. With the supercommittee split evenly between the two parties, seven of its 12 members will have to approve a debt-cutting plan before it can be sent to Congress for votes. That means at least one lawmaker would have to agree to a plan backed by the opposite party. ___ Associated Press writers Susanne M.

The state has accounted for between 30 percent and half of the net new jobs in the country in the past two years, depending on who is counting.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile Obama points to his universal health care as a historic achievement, Texas is often cited as an example of the need for health-care reform: A quarter of Texans lack coverage, the highest share in the country.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile Obama seeks to increase federal funding for education, Texas ranks 47th in the country for the level of state spending on schools. And while the Obama administration clamps down on pollution, Texas ranks highest in the country for the levels of toxic chemicals released into the water and carcinogens released into the air, according to Scorecard, an organization that tracks nationwide pollution data.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerry not only defends the Texas approach but has taken the lead in resisting the Obama administration\u2019s activism on health care, education and the environment, going so far as to raise the specter of secession from the union. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cOn the one side you have the Washington way of doing things \u2014 big spending and the idea that the heavy hand of government has to be present in economic life,\u201d said Joshua Trevino of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. \u201cAnd on the other hand is the model of very limited government and explicitly low taxes. That is such a stark contrast.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGarnet Coleman, a Democratic state legislator from Houston, sees the contrast from the other side. The Texas approach, he said, is \u201cthat you can step on the feet and hands and neck of your citizens and still make people rich and have low taxes. This is the new model and Perry is saying [to the rest of the country], \u2018let me show you how to do this.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerry is eager to set the two models side by side. \u201cIf you want to just get down to the pure epicenter, the nucleus of the problem in Washington, D.C., is they\u2019re spending too much money,\u201d he said in an interview with Time magazine this week. The Texas alternative, he said, is to \u201chave a tax structure that\u2019s fair, and as low as you can have it, and still deliver the services that the people require.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeveral of the other presidential contenders voice a conservative philosophy similar to Perry\u2019s, among them Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.). But as a state legislator and member of Congress, she has no state or city she can point to as evidence that she could put such a vision in place.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor now, the person most directly challenged by Perry\u2019s brand of conservatism could be Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor is seeking to secure his status as the GOP front-runner by demonstrating that he would be the toughest opponent for Obama.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut Romney offers Republican voters a less than clear-cut contrast with Obama \u2014 he was the moderate governor of a liberal state who helped create a universal health-care program that served as the model for the national health-care law signed by Obama. This week, he faced questions over his 2004 invocation of state tax increases in attempting to secure a top credit rating for the state. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTim Pawlenty and Jon Huntsman Jr. both considered some of the tools used in the Massachusetts health law as they were crafting their own reform proposals as governors of Minnesota and Utah, and both also supported a cap-and-trade approach to limiting carbon emissions.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf Perry has any weak spot in this regard, it is that Texas relied heavily on federal stimulus funds to balance its budget, despite Perry\u2019s criticism of the initiative.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut by most measures, his contrast to Obama is sharp. Texas has refused to enforce federal emissions rules for power plants and refineries. And Perry cannot be accused of considering elements of \u201cObamacare\u201d because his administration \u2014 unlike those of Pawlenty, Huntsman and Romney \u2014 has not tried to expand adult health coverage at all.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cRick Perry would be a more credible standard bearer against Obamacare than Mitt Romney simply by virtue of the fact that Mitt implemented Obamacare in Massachusetts and Perry did not do so in Texas,\u201d said Michael Cannon of the libertarian Cato Institute.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerry also presents a more subtle challenge to Romney on health care. Romney is arguing away the similarity between Massachusetts\u2019s health care law and the national law by invoking federalism \u2014 the approach was right for his state, he says, but it should not be imposed across the country.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis makes it hard for Romney to score any points on what might otherwise be a vulnerability for Perry, the high rate of uninsured in his state. If Romney believes health care is up to the state, what can he say against a state whose leaders have decided against taking action to expand coverage? \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cRomney\u2019s federalist justification for Massachusetts makes it harder for him to criticize any governor\u2019s health record,\u201d Cannon said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRomney has so far steered clear of the Perry challenge. Asked this week about Perry and Texas\u2019s impressive jobs numbers, he offered a slightly inscrutable response. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine man and a fine governor and the record of Texas, I think, speaks for itself,\u201d he said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObama\u2019s reelection team has hinted that it welcomes Perry, whose hard-edged profile it believes would be a tough sell in a general election. But the arrival of a candidate who so refutes everything the Obama administration has stood for is also likely to spur anxiety among some liberals, who accuse Obama of being too conciliatory toward Republicans.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf Obama seizes the opportunity, then he can point to Texas as the example of \u201cwhat happens if you get close to the ideal of the current Republican vision of how government should work,\u201d said Norm Ornstein of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cNo social services, close to the worst social safety net of any state in the union, and low taxes, which help to bring in large numbers of low-paying jobs and high budget deficits.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPut that way, Texas might not be the most flattering illustration for the national GOP platform. But Doug Gross, a former Iowa Republican gubernatorial nominee, said Perry\u2019s entry is good for Republicans. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cIt\u2019ll be helpful to the party and to the country because it\u2019ll give us a clearer sense of the choices available to us,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I welcome it.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmacgillisa@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-12 08:17:17", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsrick-perrys-entry-sets-up-a-clarifying-contrast20110810giqaum32aj_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 246, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 14:04:16", "created": "2011-08-12 14:04:16", "headline": "Less-revealing airport scanner software debuts at BWI", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dr-gridlock/post/less-revealing-airport-scanner-software-at-bwi/2011/08/12/gIQAGhbHBJ_blog.html?wprss=dr-gridlock", "content": "<p>New software that displays less intimate physical images is being installed in security checkpoint scanners at <a href=\"http://www.bwiairport.com/en\">Baltimore-Washington International  Marshall Airport </a>this week.</p>\n<p>They show the human form in a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/tsa-introduces-software-that-uses-less-revealing-body-scanner-images/2011/07/20/gIQAcZc7PI_story.html\">gray, cookie-cutter image</a> rather than the more revealing depictions that caused <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/12/AR2010111206580.html?sid=ST2010113005385\">an uproar</a> last fall when a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/03/AR2010010301826.html\">new generation </a>of scanners was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/29/AR2010102906766.html\">installed nationwide</a>.the outcry</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.tsa.gov/index.shtm\">Transportation Security Administration</a> responded  by developing and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/tsa-introduces-software-that-uses-less-revealing-body-scanner-images/2011/07/20/gIQAcZc7PI_story.html\">testing</a> the <a href=\"http://www.tsa.gov/ait\">new software</a>. <a href=\"http://www.metwashairports.com/reagan/reagan.htm\">Reagan National Airport</a> was one of three locations where it underwent testing.

The attacker, who authorities said may have targeted nine women since February, comes up behind his victims and uses a box cutter or razor to slash at their buttocks, Fairfax police said. None of the victims suffered serious injuries. Two of the newly reported incidents were in Fair Oaks Mall in Fairfax in February, and the third was March 11 inside H&M at Tysons Corner Center, according to authorities. Police spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell said that the three women who recently came forward said they initially believed that a hanger or clothes had simply brushed them. They contacted police after learning about the other incidents, she said. In most of the assaults, the man distracted the victim before slashing her, police have said. They said they think that he picks his victims at random. The known attacks began in February at Fair Oaks Mall, where five people were slashed. Two of the incidents occurred at Tysons Corner, police said. One was reported at Marshalls at the Greenbriar Shopping Center and one at the T.J. Maxx at Fairfax Towne Center. In the most recent attack, which occurred about 5:30 p.m. July 25, a teenager browsing at XXI Forever in Fair Oaks Mall noticed that a man behind her was bending to pick up clothes that had fallen off a rack, police said. The 18-year-old felt a sudden pain and realized that she was bleeding, police said. The man had cut through her denim shorts and underwear, police said, and she suffered a superficial 1\u00a01/2-inch wound. The suspect, whose image has been caught on surveillance tapes, is described as a heavyset 5-foot-6 Latino in his late 20s, police said. zapanav@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 13:45:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocal3-more-buttocks-slashings-in-fairfax-stores-reported20110810giqacn546i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 141, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 09:56:11", "created": "2011-08-11 13:26:12", "headline": "Featured Advertiser", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/88d97db7f251a270945db2ff9afd59ff", "content": "<a href=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/click.phdo?s=88d97db7f251a270945db2ff9afd59ff&amp;p=4\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/img.phdo?s=88d97db7f251a270945db2ff9afd59ff&amp;p=4\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 09:36:44", "guid": "false", "slug": "httpfeedswashingtonpostcomrss88d97db7f251a270945db2ff9afd59ff"}}, {"pk": 143, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 1, "updated": "2011-08-12 09:56:11", "created": "2011-08-11 14:12:57", "headline": "Obama tries to change subject back to green jobs", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/44/post/obama-tries-to-change-subject-back-to-green-jobs/2011/08/10/gIQALJLK7I_blog.html?wprss=44", "content": "<p>It\u2019s time for the president to get back on message.</p>\n<p>After spending weeks talking about topics he probably would have preferred to avoid \u2014 debt limits, deficits, a plunging stock market \u2014 President Obama will hit the road Thursday <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/44/post/after-debt-deal-obama-focuses-on-jobs-economy/2011/08/02/gIQA7cVLrI_blog.html\">to talk about jobs</a>.

Lawyer Robert Mongeluzzi was 20 minutes into his opening statement Monday when Juror No. 1 pitched backward and passed out, The Legal Intelligencer (http://bit.ly/nIVARx) reported in Thursday\u2019s edition. Mongeluzzi was describing how a traffic accident left client Gary Pettet with rotting flesh and bone after 12 surgeries. Doctors ultimately had to amputate his leg. Medics checked on the juror, who was fine and mostly suffering from embarrassment, defense lawyer Jack Snyder said. He and Mongeluzzi used the stoppage to resume settlement talks, but he said the fainting woman had no effect on his client\u2019s position. The defendant, the Port Authority Transit Corp. commuter rail line, had admitted before trial that its truck driver was liable for the collision, Snyder said. A bridge security video shows PATCO driver Stephen Cassidy running a red light before the crash. Pettet, a 55-year-old cement mason from Berlin, N.J., had been on his way to work on July 3, 2007, and had just crossed a bridge into Philadelphia when he was struck by the PATCO truck and shoved into a median strip. His right ankle was shattered and he broke several bones in his leg. In his opening, Mongeluzzi described a debriding procedure that doctors performed to try to rid the leg of a serious infection. The doctors \u201ccut the infected, rotting flesh out of his ankle. And that includes his skin, that includes the subcutaneous muscle, and that includes dead, rotting, infected bone,\u201d Mongeluzzi explained. Co-counsel Andrew Duffy noticed the juror, a teacher from the city\u2019s Chestnut Hill neighborhood, wincing before she passed out. Snyder, though, isn\u2019t convinced she fainted because of the subject matter. The uncomfortably hot courtroom temperature could be to blame, he said. Mongeluzzi said the settlement figure is twice what PATCO offered his client before trial. But Snyder says the two sides had reduced the gap between them to about $4 million \u2014 with PATCO offering $8.5 million and Mongeluzzi seeking $12.5 million \u2014 when they agreed to meet near the middle.  \u201cI\u2019ve been around a long time, so I think I\u2019ve pretty much seen everything,\u201d Snyder told The Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cThis just adds to it.\u201d ___ Information from: The Legal Intelligencer, http://thelegalintelligencer.com Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

Each seeks to become the main challenger to Republican front-runner Mitt Romney. Their efforts were newly complicated by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who stole some of the spotlight from afar by making it known hours before the debate that he was running for the GOP nomination. Romney, a multimillionaire businessman who casts himself as a jobs creator, made his own stir earlier in the day when, at the Iowa State Fair, he declared that \u201ccorporations are people,\u201d drawing ridicule from Democrats. Those were just the latest twists in the most consequential week yet in the 2012 Republican presidential nomination fight. In the two-hour debate, the squabbling by Pawlenty and Bachmann allowed Romney, the GOP front-runner making his second presidential bid, to remain above the fray and emerge relatively unscathed by his rivals. Though every debate participant assailed President Barack Obama, it was clear from the confrontations between Pawlenty, a former Minnesota governor, and Bachmann, now a member of Congress, who had the most on the line ahead of Saturday\u2019s straw poll that could well winnow the field. On stage just a few minutes, Pawlenty, who is struggling to gain traction despite spending years laying the groundwork for his campaign, accused Bachmann of achieving nothing significant in Congress, lacking executive experience and having a history of fabrications.  \u201cShe\u2019s got a record of misstating and making false statements,\u201d Pawlenty said. Bachmann, who has risen in polls since entering the race this summer and has eclipsed Pawlenty, quickly responded with a list of what she called Pawlenty\u2019s liberal policies when he was Minnesota\u2019s governor, including his support for legislation to curb industrial emissions.  \u201cYou said the era of small government is over,\u201d she told Pawlenty. \u201cThat sounds a lot like Barack Obama if you ask me.\u201d Much of the rest of the debate was heavily focused on the Democratic incumbent, with Romney and his seven rivals each seeking to prove he or she was the strongest Republican to take on Obama.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to eat Barack Obama\u2019s dog food,\u201d Romney said when asked whether he would have vetoed the compromise legislation that Congress gave to the president that raised the debt ceiling. \u201cWhat he served up is not what I would have done if I\u2019d had been president of the United States.\u201d Notably absent from the eight-candidate spectacle were Perry, who was in Texas preparing for a weekend announcement tour to early primary states, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who isn\u2019t a candidate but was stoking presidential speculation anew with a visit to the Iowa State Fair. The nation\u2019s teetering economic situation shadowed the debate, with stock market volatility and a downgrade in the U.S. credit rating giving Republicans ample opportunities to criticize Obama. The Democratic president will get his shot to counter the criticism next week during a Midwestern bus tour that will take him through this state that helped launch him on the path to the White House four years ago. On Thursday, he, too, tried to align himself with a public fed up with economic uncertainty and Washington gridlock. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with our country. There is something wrong with our politics,\u201d he declared in Michigan, where he was touring an advanced-battery factory In Iowa Thursday night, the Republicans commanded the spotlight. Seven candidates \u2014 Pawlenty, Bachmann, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and businessman Herman Cain \u2014 sought to separate themselves from the packed field and emerge as the chief alternative to Romney. Pawlenty, who hesitated in a June debate to criticize the former Massachusetts governor, this time accused him of sharing views with Obama on spending and health care.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to show contrast, not similarities\u201d with the incumbent president, Pawlenty said. He sought repeatedly to tie Romney and Obama together by poking at both.  \u201cWhere\u2019s Barack Obama on these issues. You can\u2019t find his plans on the most pressing issues in this country,\u201d Pawlenty said, promising audience members and TV viewers he would \u201ccome to your house and cook you dinner\u201d if they could find Obama\u2019s proposals. \u201cOr if you prefer I\u2019ll come to your house and mow your lawn ... In case Mitt wins, I\u2019d limit it to one acre.\u201d Romney, who has several homes, smiled and took a pass when given a chance to respond, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s just fine.\u201d He kept his focus on Obama, saying: \u201cOur president simply doesn\u2019t understand how to lead and how to grow the economy.\u201d He also criticized Democrat Obama on the downgrade of the nation\u2019s credit rating. Appearing in his first presidential debate, Huntsman acknowledged he had not yet presented an economic plan, but he cited his economic record as governor of Utah as evidence of what he would accomplish as president. He defended his service as ambassador to China under Obama as a patriotic act. Huntsman, who is not competing in the Iowa caucuses where social conservatives dominate, also tried to differentiate himself from the rest of the field. He defended his support for civil unions and offered no apologies for other moderate positions he holds. Gingrich, pressed on the implosion of his campaign amid financial strife and infighting earlier this summer, chastised the Fox News panel for \u201cgotcha questions.\u201d He said Republicans including Ronald Reagan and John McCain had staff defections during their campaigns, and he said he intended, in his words, to \u201crun on ideas.\u201d Roughly 45 minutes into the debate, Santorum raised his hand and said: \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten to say a lot.\u201d Showing the wide diversity of opinion, Paul gave a staunchly libertarian answer to nearly every question from the economy to foreign affairs, essentially saying the United States should have friendly relations even with countries that violate human rights and not interfere in their internal affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s about time we talk to Cuba,\u201d Paul said at one point. He also said the United States had created the hostile relations between itself and Iran. Even before the debate began, it was a campaign day to remember. At an appearance early in the day, Romney was badgered by hecklers at the state fair. In response to chanting about corporations, he said that \u201ccorporations are people,\u201d a comment Democrats predicted would be a defining moment of his campaign. Romney, who has struggled with an aloof and elitist image as he tries for the GOP presidential nomination a second time, made the remark while outlining options for reducing the federal deficit and overhauling entitlement programs. Despite tea party outrage that sometimes focuses on banks and auto companies, Romney has said to applause from GOP audiences that the rights of business are being trampled under Obama to the detriment of the struggling economy. But in Thursday\u2019s audience, the line encountered resistance. A few hours after Romney\u2019s awkward moment, Perry spokesman Mark Miner confirmed that the Texas governor would announce that he was running for president while in early primary states on Saturday. Perry\u2019s candidacy is certain to upend the race, and he could challenge Romney for the role of jobs-focused candidate. The conservative governor is seen as a potential bridge between the party\u2019s social and economic wings. Asked about Perry\u2019s candidacy during the debate, several of his opponents welcomed him to the race \u2014 and used the opportunity to criticize him. Cain called Perry \u201cone more politician,\u201d while Paul said he was pleased Perry was joining the field because \u201che represents the status quo.\u201d Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

He showed illustrations of transit-oriented development in Pleasant Hill, Calif., and Sao Paolo, Brazil. But, he said, the group didn\u2019t really need to look around the world to find a model. There was one a few miles away in Arlington County.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Arlington way\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Arlington planners of today are building \u2014 literally, in some cases \u2014 on the choices made by a previous generation that placed Metro stations  like \u201ca string of pearls,\u201d to use Cervero\u2019s phrase.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut how do you create an appropriate ensemble around the jewelry? Over the years, Arlington coordinated the physical element, its transit, with policies that concentrated development at transit stations to create a variety of residential, office and entertainment attractions.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDid that come off as the planners intended, and if so, can it be duplicated wherever people want a similar environment? Within Arlington\u2019s boundaries, can the county government and community leaders preserve their successes and take them to another level?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThey look to one new planning tool to provide some guidance. It\u2019s a survey of the D.C. region\u2019s households and their travel habits developed by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and enhanced with further research to deepen the findings within Arlington.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLori Diggins, an independent consultant whose firm, LDA Consulting, analyzed the data for Arlington, said the survey is an unusually deep look at one jurisdiction. It looks at travel patterns in ways that get beyond the basics of the commute by examining how people get from one place to another throughout the day, and why they\u2019re moving around.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe need to care about all those other trips,\u201d said Dennis Leach, the county\u2019s transportation director. \u201cWe need to capture everything.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeach, who\u2019s been in that job for seven years, thinks the county has used the transit and land use strategy developed decades ago to create communities that work pretty well, but   \u201cwe\u2019re never done.\u201d He foresees at least four decades of retrofitting and refining.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis view treats the Orange Line and the Blue Line as a great start, then adds sidewalks, bus hubs, bike routes and enhanced travel information to the getting-around strategy. It looks at how people move, not just vehicles.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeach also knows that the county government needs to have the data when its own communities look over new development and transportation plans: \u201cWe need to be able to tell the story of how these neighborhoods perform, how do people travel,  in addressing people\u2019s concerns about change.\u201d  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOften, the transportation and land use plans increase density. Is that going to create a better place, or just add traffic? \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Arlington County Household Survey is the story so far. Here are some of its findings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tToday\u2019s Arlingtonians\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe county shaped by the transportation and land use plans has more single-person households than the region at large and a smaller household size.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAge: A quarter of county residents are 19 to 34, versus 16 percent for the region.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing: 51 percent of Arlington residents live in multi-family housing, more than double the regional rate, and slightly lower than the District  and Alexandria.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIncome: 47 percent have annual household incomes of $100,000 or more, making Arlington more affluent than other parts of the urban core.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVehicles:  92 percent of households own vehicles, a rate similar to the region\u2019s. But Arlington is \u2014 as the county government likes to say \u2014  \u201ccar lite\u201d: Only 78 percent of households have one or more vehicles per driver, versus 84 percent for the region.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBikes:  50 percent of households own one or more, a rate slightly lower than the region\u2019s but higher than that for the District or Alexandria.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow they travel\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe county\u2019s physical environment and its transportation policies encourage residents to leave their cars at home. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDriving: Arlington residents make  40 percent of daily trips by driving solo, a rate lower than that for any part of the region except the District. When they drive alone, it\u2019s most often for work, commuting or shopping. They drive alone for 33 percent of trips made within the county.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlternatives: They make a larger share of daily trips by transit and walking than do residents in any part of the region other than the District: 16 percent of trips are on foot, 11 percent are by train or bus, about three in 10 trips are by driving or riding with others.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThey use transit primarily for commuting, work-related travel and socializing. They use transit for few shopping trips, probably because of the packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWalking: They walk 23 percent of trips made within the county. The do it for all purposes, but most often for recreation, meals, socializing and entertainment. They walk for 17 percent of work trips and an equal share of school trips. They are more likely to walk to transit than residents regionwide.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTransit corridors: Residents of the Rosslyn-Ballston (Orange Line) and Jefferson Davis Highway (Blue  Line) corridors drive alone less and walk or use transit more than than other county residents. Just over a third of trips to those two corridors are made by solo drivers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tActive travelers: Arlington residents make more total trips per day than the regional average \u2013 3.9 versus 3.5 \u2014 but they travel fewer miles per day than the regional average, because their trips are shorter: 15.8 miles versus 25.6 miles. They also travel fewer miles in vehicles than the regional average, because they are more likely to use transit or walk.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthomsonr@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-12 10:14:09", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocalcommutingarlington-shapes-residents-travel-habits20110811giqabpumbj_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 249, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 14:04:16", "created": "2011-08-12 14:04:16", "headline": "Heroin \u2018lamp shades\u2019 lead to arrests", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/crime-scene/post/heroin-lamp-shades-lead-to-arrests/2011/08/12/gIQAvj32AJ_blog.html?wprss=crime-scene", "content": "<p>The overseas package was making its way to a home in Northwest Washington last week when customs officers decided to open it at John F.

Plesiosaurs, which lived at the time of dinosaurs, were large carnivorous sea animals with broad bodies and two pairs of flippers. Researchers have long questioned whether they would have been able to crawl onto land and lay eggs like other reptiles or gave birth in the water like whales.  \u201cThis is the first evidence of live birth in plesiosaurs \u2014 an exciting find,\u201d said geology professor Judy A. Massare of the State University of New York, Brockport, who was not part of the research team. The newly unveiled fossil was originally discovered in 1987 in Logan County in Kansas. Encased in rock, it had been stored in the basement of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County until resources were available to separate the bones for display at the museum. F. Robin O\u2019Keefe of Marshall University in Huntington, W. Va., and the museum\u2019s Luis Chiappe uncovered the bones of an adult plesiosaur (PLEE\u2019-see-uh-sawr) and the remains of a fetus inside her. The museum dated the fossil, which is more than 15 feet long, to between 72 million and 78 million years ago. The researchers report on their analysis of the pregnant plesiosaur in Friday\u2019s edition of the journal Science. O\u2019Keefe said he had seen photos of the fossil, but was still surprised when he first saw it.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared for the emotional response I had,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou don\u2019t very often walk up to one and say: \u2018That is a really cool fossil.\u2019\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u201dI walked around it for about a half hour, it excited me the way I used to get excited as a kid,\u201d he said. There had been evidence of live births in an ancestor of plesiosaurs. But the lack of proof for plesiosaur birth has been puzzling, said R. Ewan Fordyce, head of the geology department at the University of Otago, New Zealand, who was not involved in the research. Fordyce said the researchers do a good job showing \u201cthat this is a fetus and not a young animal that has been eaten.\u201d  He said it was the right size for a fetus and in the right place, and there\u2019s no sign that it had been eaten and digested. Anthony Russell of the biological science department at the University of Calgary, Canada, called the find \u201csignificant.\u201d  \u201cIt would be hard to imagine these animals coming out onto land laying eggs somewhere,\u201d he added, so arguing that all plesiosaurs were doing this is a reasonable hypothesis. In their paper, O\u2019Keefe and Chiappe suggest a parallel between plesiosaurs and modern whales, also large animals that give birth to relatively big offspring. Like whales, they said, plesiosaurs may have formed social groups and tended their young. ___ Online: Science: http://www.sciencemag.org Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Dow Jones industrial average soared 423 points. It had already fallen 634 points Monday, risen 429 Tuesday and fallen 519 Wednesday. Never before has the Dow had four 400-point swings in a row. The pieces of news that sent Wall Street rocketing higher were not exactly blockbusters: Cisco Systems said its profit was better than expected, the job market got a little better, and France tried to raise confidence in its shaken banking system. But this is a week in which any move by the market \u2014 higher or lower \u2014 seems to touch off an investor stampede. So it was on Thursday, when stocks shot higher at the opening bell and never turned around. Carlton Neel, who manages about $2 billion as a senior portfolio manager at Virtus Investment Partners, said investors are so scared of being late to a rally or a sell-off that they are trading in herds.  \u201cFear tends to be a much more powerful emotion, and the sell-offs tend to be more violent than the rallies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people are worried about missing the bottom, so you will have a few melt-ups along the way.\u201d The four days of trading this week have been the wildest for the market since the financial crisis during the fall of 2008. Each day has instantly taken a place in Wall Street history. The Dow\u2019s losses on Monday and Wednesday were its sixth- and ninth-largest by points, and its gains on Tuesday and Thursday were the 10th- and 11th-largest. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has also risen or fallen at least 4 percent each day. That has not happened on four consecutive days since November 2008, the depths of the crisis. It\u2019s only the third time since 1934, said Kevin Pleines, an analyst at Birinyi Associates. The first was October 1987 \u2014 including the day known as Black Monday, when the S&P plunged more than 20 percent. On Thursday, American investors got an encouraging report before the market opened when European stock markets turned around their losses and had one of their best days in recent weeks. The leaders of Germany and France, the biggest economies of the nations that use the euro currency, announced they will meet Tuesday to discuss the financial crisis on the continent. The stocks of French banks have been hammered because of concerns they will be hit with massive losses from European sovereign debt. One European nation after another has struggled with debt, with Spain and Italy the latest. France is trying to assure financial markets that it will not be downgraded from AAA, as the United States was. All three leading credit rating agencies reaffirmed the top rating for France. An hour before the U.S. markets opened, the government reported that fewer Americans joined the unemployment line last week. The number filing for unemployment benefits fell below 400,000, the first time that has happened since April. When the opening bell rang, technology stocks led the market higher. Cisco Systems, a maker of computer equipment, rose more than 15 percent after it reported profit that was better than Wall Street expected. It also said its revenue this quarter would also be better than expected. The Dow finished at 11,143.31, up 423.37 points, or about 4 percent. The S&P 500 finished up 4.6 percent and the Nasdaq composite index 4.7 percent. It was three weeks ago, on July 22, when the stock market began a long losing streak. Investors were worried mostly about the showdown in Washington over whether to raise the nation\u2019s borrowing limit. Then came one sign after another that economic growth was much slower than analysts had thought, in addition to growing worries about the debt crisis in Europe and the stability of European banks. During those three weeks, the Dow is down almost 1,600 points, or about 12 percent. It is still up 70 percent since its post-meltdown low of March 9, 2009. President Barack Obama acknowledged this week\u2019s wild market swings and made another attempt to calm the nerves of Americans who have watched their retirement accounts and other investments shrivel since mid-July. The president toured a plant in Holland, Mich., that makes batteries for hybrid cars and trucks and said he understands that the volatility \u201cmakes folks nervous\u201d and has hammered savings accounts. He reeled off a list of challenges for the economy \u2014 unrest in the Middle East, an earthquake in Japan that disrupted American manufacturing, a European financial crisis that has hit U.S. banks, and lingering damage from the Great Recession. But he declared: \u201cThere is nothing wrong with our country. There is something wrong with our politics.\u201d Standard & Poor\u2019s cited dysfunction in the American political system, not just the nation\u2019s long-term debt, when it stripped the United States of its top-flight AAA credit rating last Friday. Even after the downgrade, investors have found U.S. Treasury bonds and bills irresistible, seeing them as a haven of safety during an uncertain time. The demand has pushed up the price of U.S. debt, which has lowered yields. On Thursday, the Treasury sold $16 billion worth of 30-year bonds at a 3.75 percent yield, the lowest borrowing rate for the government on that security since March 2009. Yields for shorter-term American debt rose, but that appeared to be a response to the huge rally in stocks. Yields usually rise when the stock market has a big day because it takes a bigger rate of return to get investors interested in bonds. Gold fell $32.80 per ounce to $1,751.50 Thursday. It had rocketed above $1,800 per ounce for the first time on Wednesday as stock markets tumbled around the world. Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But they didn\u2019t have evidence until a cold case squad tested the girl\u2019s thermal underwear five years ago, said assistant Lucas County Prosecutor Chris Anderson. Bowman, who had been a successful businessman in Toledo before disappearing into a life on the streets in Florida and California, is charged with murder in the death of 14-year-old Eileen Adams. Investigators think Bowman kidnapped her, held her captive in his basement for as long as two weeks and then killed her. He has pleaded not guilty and faces life in prison if he\u2019s convicted. Adams, a high school freshman, was last seen getting off a bus about a block from her sister\u2019s Toledo home, Anderson said during opening statements of the trial on Thursday. She was supposed to go there after school but never showed up. Her sister, Mary Ann Brimmer, testified that she stood at the front door waiting for Eileen to arrive at her house just like every other day. \u201cShe\u2019d never been late before,\u201d Brimmer said. The body was found six weeks later in southern Michigan, about 11 miles from the bus stop. She had been tied up with telephone and drapery cords. A nail had been driven into her head. Bowman\u2019s attorney said that prosecutors don\u2019t know where or when the girl died and that the DNA evidence doesn\u2019t conclusively point to Bowman. \u201cYou can\u2019t say with precision what happened,\u201d said defense attorney Peter Rost. Bowman\u2019s former wife is expected to testify that she found Adams alive in their basement in the days after the girl vanished. Margaret Bowman said during a pretrial hearing last year that she opened the door to a fruit cellar and found the girl naked and bound with ropes. She went to police in 1981 and told them that she tried to help the girl, but her husband came home. She said he told her that he had to kill the girl and threatened to kill his wife if she told anyone what she saw. That was the first time anyone connected Bowman to the killing. Bowman\u2019s attorney said Thursday that Margaret Bowman didn\u2019t go to police willingly years ago. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to decide how believable she is,\u201d Rost said. Detectives tracked Bowman down in Florida in 1982 but didn\u2019t think they had enough evidence to bring charges. He was living in an abandoned restaurant, wearing a tattered shirt and jeans and a scruffy beard. Bowman, his attorney said, had become involved in an offbeat religion and gave up all of his material things. Inside the abandoned building, there were several dolls \u2014 one was hanging from the ceiling with twine tied around its ankles and another had a nail driven in the back of its head, Anderson said. Three more decades passed until cold-case detectives took DNA samples from Bowman\u2019s ex-wife and their daughter and compared those samples with DNA found on Adams\u2019 clothing. Police charged Bowman even though they had no idea where he was living or even if he was still alive. He was profiled on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d and police in California arrested him in 2008 near Palm Springs after he was spotted riding a bicycle. His attorney said he had been living in the desert under a tarp. Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Sales have jumped for books by Philip Levine, a Pulitzer Prize winner who on Wednesday was named the U.S. poet laureate. Within a day of the Library of Congress\u2019 announcement, several of Levine\u2019s books had sold out on Amazon.com, including \u201cNews of the World\u201d and \u201cThe Simple Truth.\u201d E-book readers also will have to wait. Little of Levine\u2019s work, or of any poetry, is available electronically because verse is so difficult to format for digital devices. Lena Khidritskaya, a spokeswoman for Alfred A. Knopf, said the publisher planned to have e-editions for the collections \u201cWhat Work Is\u201d and \u201cThe Simple Truth\u201d out by the end of the month and for many others by September. The paperback of \u201cWhat Work Is\u201d ranked No. 110 on Amazon as of Thursday morning, a status rarely held by a book of poetry.  \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. It never occurred to me that would happen,\u201d Levine said Thursday during a telephone interview from his home in Fresno, Calif. Levine, 83, who is known for his celebrations of the working class, wondered if the weak economy was a reason for the increased interest in his work.  \u201cThe same thing happened when \u2018What Work Is\u2019 won the National Book Award (in 1991),\u201d he said. \u201cIt was also a time of great strife in the labor market.\u201d Being poet laureate means Levine will likely get to meet President Barack Obama, among the most literary of presidents. Levine said he was a supporter of Obama in 2008 and was thrilled by his election. But he says he would have been happier to see the president right after his victory.  \u201cThe problem with meeting him now is I wouldn\u2019t exactly know how to relate to him. Like so many people who believed in what he would do, there is a disappointment,\u201d said Levine, citing the continued war in Afghanistan and Obama\u2019s agreement to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the rich. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be rude, but it would be a kind of fraught situation.\u201d Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

The person who brought the case \u2014 another psychologist \u2014 doesn\u2019t have legal standing to do so,  Manhattan Civil Court Judge Saliann Scarpulla said in a ruling filed Thursday. Rights activists and some psychologists have pressed regulators in several states \u2014 unsuccessfully so far \u2014 to explore whether psychologists violated professional rules by designing or observing abusive interrogations. In New York, rights advocates focused on John F. Leso, saying he developed \u201cpsychologically and physically abusive\u201d interrogation techniques for use on detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The state Office of Professional Discipline, which oversees psychologists, declined last year to look into Leso. The agency said that his Army work is outside its purview and that the agency isn\u2019t in a position to address larger questions about the appropriateness of detainee interrogation methods. The decision spurred the San Francisco-based Center for Justice and Accountability, the New York Civil Liberties Union and psychologist Steven Reisner to sue the agency last fall and ask the judge to force a review of techniques developed by Leso, who holds a New York psychologists\u2019 license.  \u201cThe ruling is unfortunate, as Dr. Reisner\u2019s claims raise serious and fundamental questions that should have their day in court,\u201d Center for Justice and Accountability lawyer Kathy Roberts said in a statement. She said the groups are considering an appeal but also keeping their eye on proposed state legislation that would require investigating any allegation that a health care professional has participated in torture or other improper treatment. Representatives for the state professional discipline office and the state Attorney General\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately return calls. No contact information was immediately available for Leso, who isn\u2019t named in the court case and never chose to weigh in with a filing of his own. An Army spokesman didn\u2019t immediately return a call about Leso. While leading a behavioral science consultation team at Guantanamo in 2002 and 2003, Leso recommended interrogation tactics such as exposing detainees to severe cold, depriving them of sleep and forcing liquids into them intravenously, and he participated in at least one interrogation that used some of those methods, the Center for Justice and Accountability says. It said it based its allegations on government documents, some of them redacted, as well as academic journal articles and other sources. The group and Reisner, who specializes in addressing the effects of trauma, say Leso\u2019s alleged activities amount to professional misconduct and need to be explored.  \u201cOur country is still in a quandary as to how to hold itself and its officials accountable for this dark chapter in our history, and in particular it is in a quandary with respect to those professionals who are answerable to the  higher standards embodied in professional ethical codes,\u201d Reisner said in a statement Thursday. Scarpulla told the advocates in April that she shared their \u201csensibility\u201d but wasn\u2019t sure about their legal argument. They argued that as a psychologist licensed in New York, Reisner has a personal interest in preserving the field\u2019s reputation and the value of his license. But the judge said that didn\u2019t add up to grounds to force action by the professional discipline office, which is part of the state Education Department.  \u201cThe court finds that nothing in the New York Education Law guarantees a right to each and every person that the OPD formally investigate every single complaint of professional misconduct,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe fact that pursuant to (the law) \u2018any person\u2019 is permitted to file a complaint against a psychologist does not by itself grant every person a right to have the complaint investigated.\u201d A state lawyer told the judge at the April hearing that the complaint about Leso concerned unique circumstances that had nothing to do with New York state or the patient-focused psychology practices the professional discipline agency usually examines.  \u201cThe intention here was to avoid another Sept. 11, and that\u2019s an important fact that can\u2019t be overlooked,\u201d Assistant Attorney General James M. Hershler added at the time. The American Psychological Association voted in 2008 to ban members from taking part in interrogations at the Guantanamo prison and other military detention sites where the professional group believes international law is being violated. But psychologist licensing boards in California, Louisiana, Ohio and Texas also have rejected complaints about other military psychologists who were said to have played a role in abusive interrogations of detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere. Some activists in Ohio also have turned to a court to seek to force an investigation of a retired Army psychologist there. ___ Jennifer Peltz can be reached at http://twitter.com/jennpeltz Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

Over a three-year period, the money will pay for training at the city\u2019s new Community College of D.C., part of the University of the District of Columbia, and a literacy grant program to be administered by the Community Foundation for the National Capital Region. D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) is expected to announce the partnership in a Thursday press conference. The money will pay for workforce development and job preparation for 2,000 city residents at a time when the District\u2019s unemployment rate is on the rise, up 0.6 percent to 10.4 percent in June. Lisa Mallory, director of the D.C. Department of Employment Services, said the funding is sorely needed to help prepare residents to work, \u201cnot just for Wal-Mart but for every retail employer.\u201d The donation will also further a campaign by the chain to use charitable dollars to continue to burnish its image. In November, Wal-Mart announced plans to open its first four stores in the District and hire 1,200 people by 2012. That timeline appears out of reach, as Wal-Mart has not signed leases for any of the stores, but the plans remain intact despite public requests for the company to make concessions to workers, a \u201cflash mob\u201d protest at the chain\u2019s Laurel store and multiple rallies at the chain\u2019s Washington offices. In the meantime, Wal-Mart and its foundation have poured millions of dollars into programs and charities that are close to the hearts of Gray and D.C. residents, including $2.4\u00a0million in contributions for its fiscal year ending Jan. 31 to groups such as the Boys & Girls Clubs, the Capital Area Food Bank and the Greater Washington Urban League. Wal-Mart announced $665,000 in grants for the mayor\u2019s Summer Youth Employment Program and school nutrition in June, and another $100,000 grant to help reduce pollution in the Anacostia River last week. Gray helped create the new community college, which will use the Wal-Mart money to provide customer service training and a \u201cretail academy\u201d to prepare residents for entry-level retail jobs. In an interview, Michelle D. Gilliard, a senior director at the Wal-Mart Foundation, said that workforce development was one of the foundation\u2019s four target giving areas. She said the company was committed to hiring city residents. \u201cAll companies need to develop professional, well-prepared customer service employees, and we see this as a part of that,\u201d she said. Mallory stressed that the training partnership with Wal-Mart would benefit city residents regardless of how many stores the company opened. \u201cThe Wal-Mart Foundation has stepped up to do this, but we\u2019re willing to work with anybody,\u201d she said. oconnellj@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 09:01:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocalwal-mart-donation-to-pay-for-job-training-in-dc20110810giqalskg7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_business"}}, {"pk": 159, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 14:25:49", "headline": "Actress Miranda Cosgrove breaks ankle in Illinois bus accident, postpones tour", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/actress-miranda-cosgrove-breaks-ankle-in-illinois-bus-accident-postpones-tour/2011/08/11/gIQAMgA08I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tVANDALIA, Ill. \u2014 Actress and singer Miranda Cosgrove has broken her ankle in a tour bus accident in southern Illinois.

A new Washington Post poll underscores the damage done to President Obama and both political parties by the long standoff over the debt ceiling and the weakened economy. The results could have significant implications for both Republicans and Democrats, as record numbers of Americans now say they are interested in new congressional representation when they vote in November 2012. With a double-dip recession now looming and the stock market buffeted by its steepest declines since the collapse in late 2008, the findings add another layer of pessimism to a gloomy summer. Just as the market has plunged in recent days, so, too, has public faith in the nation\u2019s leaders to deal with the problems. Anger at Washington has been growing for some time, but the latest political battle has resulted in an intensification of the discontent. A majority of Americans surveyed said they oppose the recent debt-ceiling compromise, which calls for slicing about $2\u00a0trillion from the deficit over the next decade. The highest and strongest opposition comes from Republicans, but a majority of independents also oppose the deal, according to the poll. Democrats are evenly divided on the matter. But that judgment only hints at the dissatisfaction aimed at political leaders in Washington, who must specify in excess of $1\u00a0trillion more in deficit reduction by later this fall or trigger across-the-board cuts in defense and non-defense spending. Nearly three-quarters of Americans polled said they have little or no confidence in Washington to repair the economy. Confidence is down 21\u00a0percentage points from October 2010 and is less than half its 2002 levels. Roughly four in 10 have no confidence at all in the federal government when it comes to dealing with the economy, the poll indicates. The number of people who expressed no confidence at all nearly doubled since October 2010. Almost half of independents said \u201cnone\u201d when asked about their confidence, more than double the proportion saying so last fall. Nearly eight in 10 of Americans polled were dissatisfied with the way the political system is working, up dramatically from late 2009. The unhappiness is intense, with 45 percent saying they are very dissatisfied. That feeling is shared widely across party lines. Independents are the most disgruntled, with 51\u00a0percent calling themselves very dissatisfied. More than seven in 10 said Washington is focused on the \u201cwrong things.\u201d That too is sharply higher than it was just 10 months ago. Two-thirds of Republicans who see the government as focused on the wrong things said Obama and the Democrats are to blame, and Democrats were nearly as likely to point the finger at the GOP. Among independents, a plurality \u2014 43\u00a0percent \u2014 volunteered that both sides are at fault. Half the country agrees with the assessment of the nation\u2019s financial situation rendered by Standard & Poor\u2019s, which downgraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time in history. The poll suggests that the decision by S&P had a powerful ripple effect, with 80\u00a0percent saying they had heard about the downgrading, and 45\u00a0percent saying they had heard \u201ca lot\u201d about it. The Obama administration took sharp issue last weekend with the action by Standard & Poor\u2019s, arguing that the rating agency made a $2\u00a0trillion miscalculation. But the public widely endorses S&P\u2019s condemnation of the state of the U.S. political system, which the rating agency said led to the decision to downgrade. S&P described the political system as one that has become \u201cless stable, less effective and less predictable.\u201d Asked about the S&P assessment, 71\u00a0percent of Americans polled called it fair. On the blame front, 36\u00a0percent said the GOP is culpable for the downgrade, 31 percent blamed Obama and fellow Democrats and 22\u00a0percent blamed both sides equally. The decline in confidence has potentially profound implications for coming elections, although the anger appears directed evenly between the two parties. Among those who said Washington is focused on the wrong issues, 30\u00a0percent blamed Obama and Democrats, 30\u00a0percent blamed Republicans and 32\u00a0percent blamed both sides equally. Confidence in Obama to make the right decisions for the country\u2019s economic future is down 10 points, to 33 percent, since January. Confidence in congressional Republicans, at 35 percent in January, dropped to 18 percent. More Americans polled said both Obama and Republicans have made things worse than said either side has made progress, although Republicans were judged more harshly on this question. Just 10 percent of those surveyed said Republicans have made progress in solving major problems, compared with 19 percent who said as much of Obama. Thirty-five percent said Republicans have made things worse, and 28\u00a0percent said the same about the president. Obama\u2019s overall job ratings were 44\u00a0percent approval and 46\u00a0percent disapproval in the new poll, both down from three weeks ago, when he was at 47 and 48\u00a0percent, respectively. In this one-night poll, 10\u00a0percent expressed no opinion on this question, twice the mid-July level. There was one bright spot in the poll: 77 percent of Americans agree with this statement: \u201cWhatever its faults, the United States still has the best system of government in the world.\u201d That number was unmoved from October 2010. cohenj@washpost.com balzd@washpost.com Polling manager Peyton M.

But the panel didn\u2019t go as far as a lower court that had invalidated the entire overhaul as unconstitutional.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe states and other critics argued the law violates people\u2019s rights, while the Justice Department countered that the legislative branch was exercising a \u201cquintessential\u201d power.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe decision, penned by Chief Judge Joel Dubina and Circuit Judge Frank Hull, found that \u201cthe individual mandate contained in the Act exceeds Congress\u2019s enumerated commerce power.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cWhat Congress cannot do under the Commerce Clause is mandate that individuals enter into contracts with private insurance companies for the purchase of an expensive product from the time they are born until the time they die,\u201d the opinion said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCircuit Judge Stanley Marcus disagreed in a dissent.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe 11th Circuit isn\u2019t the first appeals court to weigh in on the issue. The federal appeals court in Cincinnati upheld the government\u2019s new requirement that most Americans buy health insurance, and an appeals court in Richmond has heard similar legal constitutional challenges to the law.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the Atlanta-based court is considered by many observers to be the most pivotal legal battleground yet because it reviewed a sweeping ruling by a Florida judge.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tU.S. District Judge Roger Vinson\u2019s ruling not only struck down a requirement that nearly all Americans carry health insurance, but he also threw out other provisions ranging from Medicare discounts for some seniors to a change that allows adult children up to age 26 to remain on their parents\u2019 coverage.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe states urged the 11th Circuit to uphold Vinson\u2019s ruling, saying in a court filing that letting the law stand would set a troubling precedent that \u201cwould imperil individual liberty, render Congress\u2019s other enumerated powers superfluous, and allow Congress to usurp the general police power reserved to the states.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Justice Department countered that Congress had the power to require most people to buy health insurance or face tax penalties because Congress has the authority to regulate interstate business. It said the legislative branch was exercising its \u201cquintessential\u201d rights when it adopted the new law.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDuring oral arguments in June, the three-judge panel repeatedly raised questions about the overhaul and expressed unease with the insurance requirement. Each of the three worried aloud if upholding the landmark law could open the door to Congress adopting other sweeping economic mandates.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe arguments unfolded in what\u2019s considered one of the nation\u2019s most conservative appeals courts. But the randomly selected panel represents different judicial perspectives. None of the three is considered either a stalwart conservative or an unfaltering liberal.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDubina, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, is not considered to be as reflexively conservative as some of his colleagues. But he\u2019s been under particular scrutiny because of his daughter\u2019s outspoken opposition to the health care overhaul. U.S. Rep. Martha Dubina Roby, a Montgomery, Ala., Republican elected in November, voted to repeal the health care law.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcus and Hull were both tapped by President Bill Clinton to join the court. But Marcus was also previously appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan to serve on the Florida bench after several years as Miami\u2019s lead federal prosecutor. And Hull, a former county judge in Atlanta, is known for subjecting both sides of the counsel table to challenging questions.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t___\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBluestein can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/bluestein\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCopyright 2011 The Associated Press.

Growing numbers of Obama\u2019s allies, beyond the liberal activists who have expressed disappointment in the past, contend that he has trimmed his sails too much since the party\u2019s electoral defeats last fall. This sentiment has sharpened in the wake of the negotiations over the debt ceiling, when the president accepted Republican demands for spending cuts without obtaining guarantees of tax revenue increases, which he said were necessary for a \u201cbalanced approach.\u201d Obama\u2019s standing has been further challenged by a string of recent events that are testing his presidential mettle: the first-ever credit downgrade of the U.S. government by the Standard & Poor\u2019s rating agency on Friday night, a helicopter crash in Afghanistan that same night that killed 22 Navy SEALs and eight other service members, and a topsy-turvy stock market once again prompting fears of a double-dip recession. \u201cThe president has shown himself unwilling to just dig in on a position,\u201d said Dee Dee Myers, who was Bill Clinton\u2019s White House press secretary. \u201cHe\u2019s for jobs. I\u2019ve heard him say that. He\u2019s for being the grown-up in the room. But beyond that, I\u2019m not actually sure what his bottom line is.\u201d Polling indicates that Republicans are taking the brunt of the blame for bringing the country to the brink of default, but the president has come out of that fight looking weaker, as well. Recent polls have shown Obama\u2019s job approval at or near the lowest of his presidency \u2014 and the public\u2019s view of how he is handling the economy is lower still. As a result, more Democrats are saying it is time for him to scrap his more cautious, conciliatory approach and advocate bolder programs that would generate jobs and economic growth, even though many of those ideas would have no chance of passing Congress. \u201cThe market has called us out, and you have to rethink under these circumstances,\u201d said Andy Stern, former president of the Service Employees International Union and a close White House ally. Of the relatively modest initiatives that the White House is currently advocating, Stern added: \u201cPatent reform, trade, unemployment insurance, cutting taxes \u2014 that doesn\u2019t generate the jobs we need.\u201d Added Neera Tanden, a former Obama and Clinton administration official who is now chief operating officer at the liberal Center for American Progress: \u201cHe can take his ideas to the Republicans and use the House Republicans\u2019 intransigence on his ideas as a foil. And by having a fight on jobs, he will communicate to the American people that he understands their challenges and he\u2019s on their side.\u201d Peter Fenn, a longtime Democratic strategist, said the even-keeled president has \u201cgot to be a lot less keep-it-cool Calvin Coolidge and a lot more give-\u2019em-hell Harry Truman.\u201d \u201cThere has got to be a willingness to get tough with the Republicans, especially the tea party wing,\u201d Fenn said. If there is a hallmark of Obama\u2019s campaign and governing style, however, it is an aversion to second-guessing, making it unlikely that the White House will respond to the unrest with any major overhaul. His aides note that his unconventional 2008 presidential campaign also faced plenty of naysaying but ultimately proved successful. But back then, Obama was running as an agent of change. Next year, his challenge will be to defend his record and to prove that his approach to governing is superior to what the Republicans are offering. And although polls show that Americans are far more approving of Obama\u2019s job performance than that of GOP lawmakers, those lawmakers won\u2019t be on the presidential ballot. The White House is showing a willingness to take outside advice, something aides concede did not happen enough before the midterm elections. Obama\u2019s campaign flew a number of Democratic political consultants to Chicago on Monday for a day-long roundtable session with campaign manager Jim Messina and political strategist David Axelrod. White House officials say the president has a broad set of challenges: to prove that he can tame the deficit, to push for what is actually achievable under a divided government and to lay out a more ambitious vision of what he would try to accomplish in a second term. They dismiss the suggestion that these goals present any contradiction as they map their electoral and legislative strategy. \u201cHe is committed to meeting all three of these responsibilities, and not one at the expense of the other,\u201d said Gene Sperling, Obama\u2019s top economic adviser. Obama\u2019s aides say the president has a responsibility to explore policies that have a chance of passage, rather than merely making a political statement. They add that he will roll out additional ideas in the coming weeks geared toward creating jobs, helping the middle class, and guiding lawmakers on a \u201cbalanced\u201d way to cut deficits, raise taxes on the wealthy and adjust entitlements. But the aides also signaled Obama\u2019s intention to try to hold the GOP accountable: If those measures fail to win passage in Congress, said senior adviser David Plouffe, \u201cwe\u2019re going to make it clear to the American people why that is.\u201d One reason the White House may not want to shift gears now is that doing so would \u201ctacitly acknowledge that his first-term program didn\u2019t deliver the prosperity his economic team promised,\u201d said Robert J. Shapiro, who was the top economic adviser to Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign. \u201cThe truth is, everybody in the country thinks it failed. It worked to rescue us from a depression, but it didn\u2019t work to create a strong recovery.\u201d Shapiro argued that Obama should, among other moves, call for cutting the employer-paid side of the payroll tax in half and propose a temporary loan program for homeowners with troubled mortgages. Some Democrats have criticized Obama\u2019s monotone speech Monday, his first statement since the S&P downgrade of the nation\u2019s credit rating. In that speech, broadcast live as graphics on the television screen showed the stock market plummeting, he promised to offer suggestions to the new congressional supercommittee that was formed to explore additional deficit reduction as part of last week\u2019s debt-ceiling deal. But later, his spokesman declined to say how or when that might happen. The president\u2019s schedule in the coming days is not likely to comfort his Democratic critics. Although a trip to Michigan on Thursday and a two-day bus tour through the economically battered \u2014 and politically important \u2014 Midwest will put him in touch with average voters, he will then go on vacation, with a week off in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, a haven for the rich and famous. Press secretary Jay Carney defended the getaway choice on Wednesday, telling reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t think Americans out there would begrudge that notion that the president would spend some time with his family.\u201d  Polling analyst Scott Clement contributed to this report.

The MSG nightclub\u2019s practices came under scrutiny after the fatal drive-by shooting, which police said took place outside the club after an event with dancing and underage drinking. Police said they had no suspects or motive in the shooting. But MSG officials are facing criminal as well as civil charges in connection with their management of the club. In addition to the misdemeanor charges, the club was given a violation notice for allowing dancing without a dance-hall permit. \u201cThere have been countless acts of violence at that location,\u201d said Maj. George Nader, commander of the District III station. \u201cWhen we had the zoning-code violation, that\u2019s what we chose to go through on.\u201d Police identified those charged as MSG owner Eric Pickens; managers Jerome Tillery and Ronald Dixon; and employee Darryl Robinson. Each faces one count of operating a facility or event without a public dance-hall license, a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. In an interview Wednesday, Pickens said he planned to fight the charges. He said other restaurants and bars throughout Prince George\u2019s often allowed dancing even without dance-hall licenses. \u201cThey\u2019re saying anyone who has an individual who gets up and dances fits the description,\u201d Pickens said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sad that somebody lost their life and [officials are] going to grandstand and say they shut the MSG down for dancing.\u201d The case marks the first use of a new county law, passed in July, that gives the police chief and other officials broad authority to close so-called dance halls if they lack the proper permits or are deemed a threat to public safety. Police sources said the department chose to pursue permit violations because it is difficult to prove that clubs are legally responsible for violence in or near them. Brad Goshen, an assistant associate director at the Department of Environmental Resources, said that the club was given a \u201cviolation notice\u201d Monday for operating a dance hall without a license and that it had 72 hours to appeal. (The club\u2019s owners had not appealed as of Wednesday afternoon.) The order instructs the club to \u201ccease all [dance-hall] activities\u201d until it obtains a license. Other police efforts to close clubs have been stifled. In 2007, then-Prince George\u2019s Executive Jack B. Johnson (D) tried to close nine nightclubs under a county law that allowed officials to shut down businesses deemed \u201can imminent danger and threat to the health, safety and welfare of the public.\u201d A Circuit Court judge stopped five of the closures, saying officials failed to offer specific grounds for them. The clubs and the county eventually reached a deal, and the establishments were allowed to stay open. Monday\u2019s shooting occurred outside the MSG just before 3\u00a0a.m. Police said Jasmine Jerona Banks of District Heights was standing outside the club when she was hit in the head. She died the next day. A 20-year-old man was grazed by gunfire but was expected to survive, police said. Emma L. Banks, 65, said her granddaughter was a fairly recent graduate of Suitland High School who was in a training program to work in the medical field. She added that her granddaughter had a \u201cbeautiful, quiet spirit.\u201d Emma Banks said she had not heard about police efforts to close the MSG but thought that any club that posed a threat to public safety should face the same fate. \u201cClubs where violence takes place, they need to be monitored or shut down,\u201d she said. Including Monday\u2019s shooting, seven of the county\u2019s 64 homicides in 2011 have had a link to nightclubs or dance halls, compared with three in 2010 and four in 2009, police officials said. zapotoskym@washpost.com Staff researcher Madonna Lebling contributed to this report.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 17:15:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocalprince-georges-shuts-msg-nightclub-site-of-fatal-shooting20110810giqa5c2p7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 164, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 14:36:36", "headline": "Dozens evacuated because of suspicious briefcase left at Beverly Hills building", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/dozens-evacuated-because-of-suspicious-briefcase-left-at-beverly-hills-building/2011/08/11/gIQACQ118I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. \u2014 A writer desperate to get a movie script read suffered the ultimate rejection Thursday when police blew up a briefcase he said contained the screenplay after an agent refused to read it, police said.

As the housing crisis has persisted, government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, along with the Federal Housing Administration, have taken possession of hundreds of thousands of foreclosures throughout the country. But selling those homes at decent prices in an abysmal market has proven difficult. That quandary led the Treasury Department, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (which oversees Fannie and Freddie) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development on Wednesday to put out a \u201crequest for information\u201d seeking imaginative ways to clear the backlog, particularly by turning foreclosed properties into rentals. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we support the process of repair and recovery in the housing market,\u201d Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in a statement. \u201cExploring new options for selling these foreclosed properties will help expand access to affordable rental housing, promote private investment in local housing markets and support neighborhood and home price stability.\u201d Officials said they are hoping to identify private-sector partners that could purchase pools of foreclosed properties and turn them into rental units. If successful, the effort could help the government clear the backlog on its books, meet increasing rental demands and help relieve pressure on local housing prices. The agencies said they expect to hear from a range of stakeholders, including financial firms, companies with property management expertise, community groups, academics and even local governments and nonprofits. They said they aren\u2019t searching for a single, monolithic approach for the entire country, but rather solutions that make sense for individual regions with different housing challenges. The deadline to submit ideas is Sept. 15. The public-private partnerships \u201cmay reduce taxpayer losses\u201d and \u201cbring stability and liquidity to housing markets,\u201d FHFA acting Director Edward DeMarco said in a statement. Since taking office, President Obama has searched for ways to get the housing market back on its feet. Despite efforts to help struggling homeowners modify their loans and avoid foreclosures, the sluggish market and persistent unemployment perpetuated the stream of delinquencies and foreclosures. Fannie and Freddie have depended on government aid since they were seized in 2008, relying on more than $150 billion in taxpayer assistance so far. Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former Obama economic adviser, called the new effort a \u201ccommon sense\u201d  attempt to improve the housing market. He acknowledged that there are \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d about whether taxpayers might get a bad deal if the properties are sold to investors at steep discounts and whether the investors buying the foreclosures might turn out to be lousy landlords. But Bernstein said that the government already is being forced to sell repossessed properties at low prices because of the oversupply of homes on the market, and that turning a portion into rentals could actually help alleviate downward pressure on home values. He also said the government would need to vet the new owners, require that they meet standards for maintaining the properties and make sure they are managing the rentals effectively. \u201cI don\u2019t want to create the impression this is some kind of silver bullet,\u201d Bernstein said, noting previous administration efforts that have fallen short of initial goals. \u201cBut it helps.\u201d One other advantage? No congressional approval needed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go through Congress, which means you might actually be able to do it,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cIf you like this idea, and I do, that\u2019s the biggest upside because it means it can actually come to fruition.\u201d dennisb@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 17:14:15", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcombusinesseconomygovernment-owned-homes-may-get-for-rent-signs20110810giqaxxam7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_business"}}, {"pk": 10, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:18", "headline": "Poll: Spreading gloom about government; most dissatisfied with political system", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-spreading-gloom-about-government-most-dissatisfied-with-political-system/2011/08/10/gIQAXsUB7I_story.html?wprss=rss_politics", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tIn the aftermath of the tumultuous debate over raising the debt ceiling, Americans give Washington a strong vote of no confidence, with barely a quarter of those surveyed recently saying the federal government can fix the nation\u2019s economic problems and a large majority agreeing that the policymaking process is unstable and ineffective. A new Washington Post poll underscores the damage done to President Obama and both political parties by the long standoff over the debt ceiling and the weakened economy. The results could have significant implications for both Republicans and Democrats, as record numbers of Americans now say they are interested in new congressional representation when they vote in November 2012. With a double-dip recession now looming and the stock market buffeted by its steepest declines since the collapse in late 2008, the findings add another layer of pessimism to a gloomy summer. Just as the market has plunged in recent days, so, too, has public faith in the nation\u2019s leaders to deal with the problems. Anger at Washington has been growing for some time, but the latest political battle has resulted in an intensification of the discontent. A majority of Americans surveyed said they oppose the recent debt-ceiling compromise, which calls for slicing about $2\u00a0trillion from the deficit over the next decade. The highest and strongest opposition comes from Republicans, but a majority of independents also oppose the deal, according to the poll. Democrats are evenly divided on the matter. But that judgment only hints at the dissatisfaction aimed at political leaders in Washington, who must specify in excess of $1\u00a0trillion more in deficit reduction by later this fall or trigger across-the-board cuts in defense and non-defense spending. Nearly three-quarters of Americans polled said they have little or no confidence in Washington to repair the economy. Confidence is down 21\u00a0percentage points from October 2010 and is less than half its 2002 levels. Roughly four in 10 have no confidence at all in the federal government when it comes to dealing with the economy, the poll indicates. The number of people who expressed no confidence at all nearly doubled since October 2010. Almost half of independents said \u201cnone\u201d when asked about their confidence, more than double the proportion saying so last fall. Nearly eight in 10 of Americans polled were dissatisfied with the way the political system is working, up dramatically from late 2009. The unhappiness is intense, with 45 percent saying they are very dissatisfied. That feeling is shared widely across party lines. Independents are the most disgruntled, with 51\u00a0percent calling themselves very dissatisfied. More than seven in 10 said Washington is focused on the \u201cwrong things.\u201d That too is sharply higher than it was just 10 months ago. Two-thirds of Republicans who see the government as focused on the wrong things said Obama and the Democrats are to blame, and Democrats were nearly as likely to point the finger at the GOP. Among independents, a plurality \u2014 43\u00a0percent \u2014 volunteered that both sides are at fault. Half the country agrees with the assessment of the nation\u2019s financial situation rendered by Standard & Poor\u2019s, which downgraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time in history. The poll suggests that the decision by S&P had a powerful ripple effect, with 80\u00a0percent saying they had heard about the downgrading, and 45\u00a0percent saying they had heard \u201ca lot\u201d about it. The Obama administration took sharp issue last weekend with the action by Standard & Poor\u2019s, arguing that the rating agency made a $2\u00a0trillion miscalculation. But the public widely endorses S&P\u2019s condemnation of the state of the U.S. political system, which the rating agency said led to the decision to downgrade. S&P described the political system as one that has become \u201cless stable, less effective and less predictable.\u201d Asked about the S&P assessment, 71\u00a0percent of Americans polled called it fair. On the blame front, 36\u00a0percent said the GOP is culpable for the downgrade, 31 percent blamed Obama and fellow Democrats and 22\u00a0percent blamed both sides equally. The decline in confidence has potentially profound implications for coming elections, although the anger appears directed evenly between the two parties. Among those who said Washington is focused on the wrong issues, 30\u00a0percent blamed Obama and Democrats, 30\u00a0percent blamed Republicans and 32\u00a0percent blamed both sides equally. Confidence in Obama to make the right decisions for the country\u2019s economic future is down 10 points, to 33 percent, since January. Confidence in congressional Republicans, at 35 percent in January, dropped to 18 percent. More Americans polled said both Obama and Republicans have made things worse than said either side has made progress, although Republicans were judged more harshly on this question. Just 10 percent of those surveyed said Republicans have made progress in solving major problems, compared with 19 percent who said as much of Obama. Thirty-five percent said Republicans have made things worse, and 28\u00a0percent said the same about the president. Obama\u2019s overall job ratings were 44\u00a0percent approval and 46\u00a0percent disapproval in the new poll, both down from three weeks ago, when he was at 47 and 48\u00a0percent, respectively. In this one-night poll, 10\u00a0percent expressed no opinion on this question, twice the mid-July level. There was one bright spot in the poll: 77 percent of Americans agree with this statement: \u201cWhatever its faults, the United States still has the best system of government in the world.\u201d That number was unmoved from October 2010. cohenj@washpost.com balzd@washpost.com Polling manager Peyton M.

Growing numbers of Obama\u2019s allies, beyond the liberal activists who have expressed disappointment in the past, contend that he has trimmed his sails too much since the party\u2019s electoral defeats last fall. This sentiment has sharpened in the wake of the negotiations over the debt ceiling, when the president accepted Republican demands for spending cuts without obtaining guarantees of tax revenue increases, which he said were necessary for a \u201cbalanced approach.\u201d Obama\u2019s standing has been further challenged by a string of recent events that are testing his presidential mettle: the first-ever credit downgrade of the U.S. government by the Standard & Poor\u2019s rating agency on Friday night, a helicopter crash in Afghanistan that same night that killed 22 Navy SEALs and eight other service members, and a topsy-turvy stock market once again prompting fears of a double-dip recession. \u201cThe president has shown himself unwilling to just dig in on a position,\u201d said Dee Dee Myers, who was Bill Clinton\u2019s White House press secretary. \u201cHe\u2019s for jobs. I\u2019ve heard him say that. He\u2019s for being the grown-up in the room. But beyond that, I\u2019m not actually sure what his bottom line is.\u201d Polling indicates that Republicans are taking the brunt of the blame for bringing the country to the brink of default, but the president has come out of that fight looking weaker, as well. Recent polls have shown Obama\u2019s job approval at or near the lowest of his presidency \u2014 and the public\u2019s view of how he is handling the economy is lower still. As a result, more Democrats are saying it is time for him to scrap his more cautious, conciliatory approach and advocate bolder programs that would generate jobs and economic growth, even though many of those ideas would have no chance of passing Congress. \u201cThe market has called us out, and you have to rethink under these circumstances,\u201d said Andy Stern, former president of the Service Employees International Union and a close White House ally. Of the relatively modest initiatives that the White House is currently advocating, Stern added: \u201cPatent reform, trade, unemployment insurance, cutting taxes \u2014 that doesn\u2019t generate the jobs we need.\u201d Added Neera Tanden, a former Obama and Clinton administration official who is now chief operating officer at the liberal Center for American Progress: \u201cHe can take his ideas to the Republicans and use the House Republicans\u2019 intransigence on his ideas as a foil. And by having a fight on jobs, he will communicate to the American people that he understands their challenges and he\u2019s on their side.\u201d Peter Fenn, a longtime Democratic strategist, said the even-keeled president has \u201cgot to be a lot less keep-it-cool Calvin Coolidge and a lot more give-\u2019em-hell Harry Truman.\u201d \u201cThere has got to be a willingness to get tough with the Republicans, especially the tea party wing,\u201d Fenn said. If there is a hallmark of Obama\u2019s campaign and governing style, however, it is an aversion to second-guessing, making it unlikely that the White House will respond to the unrest with any major overhaul. His aides note that his unconventional 2008 presidential campaign also faced plenty of naysaying but ultimately proved successful. But back then, Obama was running as an agent of change. Next year, his challenge will be to defend his record and to prove that his approach to governing is superior to what the Republicans are offering. And although polls show that Americans are far more approving of Obama\u2019s job performance than that of GOP lawmakers, those lawmakers won\u2019t be on the presidential ballot. The White House is showing a willingness to take outside advice, something aides concede did not happen enough before the midterm elections. Obama\u2019s campaign flew a number of Democratic political consultants to Chicago on Monday for a day-long roundtable session with campaign manager Jim Messina and political strategist David Axelrod. White House officials say the president has a broad set of challenges: to prove that he can tame the deficit, to push for what is actually achievable under a divided government and to lay out a more ambitious vision of what he would try to accomplish in a second term. They dismiss the suggestion that these goals present any contradiction as they map their electoral and legislative strategy. \u201cHe is committed to meeting all three of these responsibilities, and not one at the expense of the other,\u201d said Gene Sperling, Obama\u2019s top economic adviser. Obama\u2019s aides say the president has a responsibility to explore policies that have a chance of passage, rather than merely making a political statement. They add that he will roll out additional ideas in the coming weeks geared toward creating jobs, helping the middle class, and guiding lawmakers on a \u201cbalanced\u201d way to cut deficits, raise taxes on the wealthy and adjust entitlements. But the aides also signaled Obama\u2019s intention to try to hold the GOP accountable: If those measures fail to win passage in Congress, said senior adviser David Plouffe, \u201cwe\u2019re going to make it clear to the American people why that is.\u201d One reason the White House may not want to shift gears now is that doing so would \u201ctacitly acknowledge that his first-term program didn\u2019t deliver the prosperity his economic team promised,\u201d said Robert J. Shapiro, who was the top economic adviser to Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign. \u201cThe truth is, everybody in the country thinks it failed. It worked to rescue us from a depression, but it didn\u2019t work to create a strong recovery.\u201d Shapiro argued that Obama should, among other moves, call for cutting the employer-paid side of the payroll tax in half and propose a temporary loan program for homeowners with troubled mortgages. Some Democrats have criticized Obama\u2019s monotone speech Monday, his first statement since the S&P downgrade of the nation\u2019s credit rating. In that speech, broadcast live as graphics on the television screen showed the stock market plummeting, he promised to offer suggestions to the new congressional supercommittee that was formed to explore additional deficit reduction as part of last week\u2019s debt-ceiling deal. But later, his spokesman declined to say how or when that might happen. The president\u2019s schedule in the coming days is not likely to comfort his Democratic critics. Although a trip to Michigan on Thursday and a two-day bus tour through the economically battered \u2014 and politically important \u2014 Midwest will put him in touch with average voters, he will then go on vacation, with a week off in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, a haven for the rich and famous. Press secretary Jay Carney defended the getaway choice on Wednesday, telling reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t think Americans out there would begrudge that notion that the president would spend some time with his family.\u201d  Polling analyst Scott Clement contributed to this report.

Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced their picks for the new panel.  \u201cThe lawmakers I have appointed to serve on this joint committee are proven leaders who have earned the trust and confidence of their colleagues and constituents,\u201d Boehner said in a statement.  On Tuesday,  Reid  praised his picks for their \u201cexpertise in budget matters, a commitment to a balanced approach and a track record of forging bipartisan consensus.\u201d With nine of the dozen committee members announced, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is expected to fill the final three slots any day, and she is believed to be leaning toward establishment veterans. The question now is whether this group can draw on its combined 180-plus years of congressional experience to forge an agreement or whether it will end up gridlocked in a manner similar to other special fiscal panels established to solve the nation\u2019s economic woes. Budget experts rendered a split verdict about the group\u2019s chances, with no one doubting the panel\u2019s credentials. Even the \u201csupercommittee\u2019s\u201d most junior members,  the freshman senators Toomey and  Portman, have 18 years of combined experience in the House before joining the Senate in January. Portman has also done two stints in Republican White Houses, including as President George W. Bush\u2019s director of the Office of Management and Budget. \u201cThe truth is, you\u2019ve got a lot of IQ points,\u201d Steve Bell, senior policy analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said of the selections. Bell said that he was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by most of the panel picks and that there was a \u201c50-50 chance\u201d the emerging group could craft a sweeping bipartisan pact similar to the \u201cgrand bargain\u201d that President Obama sought  to close the budget deficit.  Other budget experts were more pessimistic about the panel\u2019s chances of finding steep spending cuts. James Horney, a fiscal policy specialist at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, placed the odds of the committee\u2019s producing a big agreement at less than 25 percent. He said the appointees were the sort of dealmakers who could foster a broad pact only if party leaders loosened the reins, particularly if the Republicans are to accept increased tax revenue as part of the discussion. \u201cIf there\u2019s a desire to take a different approach, these are people who could try to work together and get things done,\u201d Horney said. The committee is the by-product of the bipartisan deal approved last week that allowed  Obama to increase the nation\u2019s debt ceiling by $900 billion this year. The deal made next year\u2019s increase contingent upon the special committee finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings over the next decade.  There are six members from each party, and a minimum of seven votes are needed to approve a final report, which would be issued before Thanksgiving. The panel would send the plan to the House and Senate floors for fast-track votes by Dec. 23. Failure to approve a report would result in an automatic reduction of $1.2 trillion in federal agency spending, equally drawn from security programs and those that benefit the middle class. After Boehner and McConnell released their picks Wednesday, Republicans slammed Reid\u2019s selection of Murray as the panel\u2019s co-chairman. As chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Murray is the chief fundraiser and campaigner for Senate Democrats in the 2012 campaign cycle. Her counterpart, Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said her position would give outside interest groups the feeling that \u201cthe pathway of influence on the deficit reduction committee runs through the coffers of a campaign committee.\u201d Democrats rejected that argument and pointed to Murray\u2019s nearly 19 years of Senate service, including senior positions on the Appropriations and Budget committees. Liberal environmental groups criticized the appointment of Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, slamming his close ties to the oil industry, whose tax breaks have been marked for possible elimination in recent debt talks. Overall, the lawmakers selected have a mixed record of forging compromise.  None were part of the bipartisan \u201cGang of Six\u201d in the Senate that proposed nearly $4 trillion in federal savings through a mix of cuts to federal agencies, entitlement reforms and increased tax revenue. Three of the supercommittee appointees \u2014 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus; Hensarling, the co-chairman of the panel; and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Camp \u2014 have opposed a similar bipartisan plan that was prepared last year by a fiscal commission appointed by Obama.  In 2005, Baucus led the Democratic opposition to GOP efforts at reforming Social Security, an issue that Republicans want to revisit. In 2008, Hensarling played a lead role in opposing the Wall Street bailout, helping to bring down the first vote on that legislation. Baucus and Camp have already been at work, along with Treasury officials, on bipartisan tax-reform issues. Upton is a bona fide moderate who had to beat back a \u201cdown with Upton\u201d campaign from a tea-party-affiliated group to claim the committee chairmanship last winter. Portman, as a House member a decade ago, forged alliances with some Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee to approve pension-reform plans. kanep@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 16:17:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsdeficit-reduction-supercommittee-stocked-with-congressional-veterans20110810giqayu3g7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 19, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:18", "headline": "Returning to Iowa, a wiser Mitt Romney avoids his past mistakes", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/returning-to-iowa-a-wiser-mitt-romney-avoids-his-past-mistakes/2011/08/08/gIQAckdO7I_story.html?wprss=rss_politics", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tMitt Romney arrived Wednesday in what he called \u201ca quintessential Iowa setting, with corn and beans around us,\u201d and made a keen observation: \u201cUnlike the last time I was at the state fair, it\u2019s going to be cool and sunny both,\u201d he told reporters here, letting his perfectly parted hair flap in the summer breeze. \u201cThe weather has markedly improved this cycle.\u201d He is hoping that Republican voters notice more than just a change in the weather. The Mitt Romney who visited Iowa on Wednesday for the first time since beginning his front-running presidential campaign is a different Mitt Romney from the one who left, scorned, in 2008 after exhausting his time and money for a second-place finish. He is betting that he has learned all the right lessons from 2008 \u2014 and not just in Iowa.  The retooled Romney is more disciplined, more confident in his policy views and seemingly more relaxed. His focus is nearly always on the economy, and his style tends toward Gap jeans and open-collared shirts with rolled-up sleeves over the starched shirts and neckties of the last go-round. And here in Iowa, Romney is setting low expectations by skipping Saturday\u2019s straw poll and instead waging a stealth effort designed to campaign enough not to ignore the state  while not appearing to be competing too hard. \u201cThere were the inevitable \u2018lessons learned,\u2019 \u201d Romney writes in his book, \u201cNo Apology,\u201d of his 2008 run. \u201cMy dad, George Romney, used to say of his 1968 presidential campaign that \u2018it was like a miniskirt .\u2009.\u2009. short and revealing.\u2019 Mine was a little longer, but just as revealing.\u201d The question for Romney is whether what he found revealing about 2008 is on the mark for 2012. Will Republican voters hungry for bold leaders who govern from the gut rally behind a methodical and cautious front-runner? \u201cRomney clearly has a playbook, and he\u2019s not diverting from the game plan. No audibles at the line of scrimmage this time. And it\u2019s working well so far,\u201d said Mark McKinnon, a longtime GOP presidential strategist who is neutral in the 2012 contest.  \u201cIt\u2019s a safe strategy,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut it may not be a safe election.\u201d Even as Romney leads the polls and has monetary and organizational advantages over his opponents, there is little evidence that he has expanded his support base far beyond where he left off in 2008. Early buzz has eluded him, instead centering on other candidates, such as Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.), and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a likely contender \u2014 and even non-candidates, such as Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. As the 2012 contest moves into a new phase this week, Romney, who has avoided direct engagements with his Republican rivals, is preparing to face an aggressive onslaught during a debate Thursday from the likes of Bachmann and former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty.  \u2018Wandering the desert\u2019 After his 2008 loss, Romney gathered his inner circle and his family to distill the lessons of his campaign. They emerged convinced that if he ran again, he would be a more authentic candidate and have a smarter strategy. \u201cHe\u2019s not a guy who doesn\u2019t learn,\u201d said Tom Rath, a senior adviser. \u201cHe knew that if he was going to move forward and stay in the game, he had to do things differently.\u201d Said Joel C. Peterson, the chairman of JetBlue Airways and a friend of Romney\u2019s: \u201cA lot of people, once they\u2019ve felt a defeat like that, wallow in it. Mitt, he just kind of stepped back and said, \u2018Okay, here\u2019s what happened,\u2019 and figured it out.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time Romney had to readjust after a loss. In 1994, he made his first run for office, challenging then-Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). The lesson he learned in that race was never to let your opponent define you. Kennedy dismissed Romney as \u201cmultiple choice\u201d for opposing abortion but  supporting abortion rights. Meanwhile, Romney was rather specific about the number of jobs he said he had created in private equity, but that left an opening for Kennedy, whose campaign aired devastating ads highlighting the jobs he was responsible for eliminating. Romney struggled to shed the label of coldhearted businessman and lost 58\u00a0percent to 41\u00a0percent.  The next time he appeared on the ballot, for governor in 2002, he won. Those who oversaw Kennedy\u2019s 1994 campaign said Romney has learned to be more vague on the stump and to avoid gaffes.  Romney has his spiel boiled down to \u201ca one-word vocabulary. All he says is \u2018jobs,\u2019 \u201d said Tad Devine, one of Kennedy\u2019s strategists. \u201cHe\u2019s really cleaned up his act.\u201d In 2008, Romney\u2019s campaign was marred by missteps and indecision. The often distracted candidate sought counsel from a pack of feuding consultants.  \u201cMitt has no intrinsic political knowledge,\u201d said Douglas E. Gross, who chaired his 2008 campaign in Iowa. \u201cHe\u2019s a consultant. Consultants come in and gee-whiz ya and leave. .\u2009.\u2009. He needed a consigliere. When he didn\u2019t have that, he was wandering the desert.\u201d This time, Romney\u2019s team is smaller and more in sync. Unlike some rival campaigns, his has not had a public disagreement. Romney trains his fire not on his GOP opponents, but on President Obama. (\u201cHe won\u2019t carry Iowa because Iowans recognize that this presidency has failed,\u201d the Republican said here on Wednesday.) He rarely submits to interviews and sometimes avoids the public. And when he is campaigning, it\u2019s usually in settings where he\u2019s most comfortable.  Wayne Berman, a Romney adviser and fundraiser, said the campaign is \u201cavoiding overexposing its candidate, it\u2019s avoiding chasing after things that undermine message discipline, and it\u2019s avoiding overspending. And those three things are the great disease of every front-running candidate.\u201d \u2018Now he is who he is\u2019 The biggest lesson Romney was told he needed to learn after 2008 was to not try to be everything to everyone. \u201cHe tried very hard to catch the rhythm of the campaign and be who people wanted him to be,\u201d said former senator Robert Bennett (R-Utah), a Romney supporter. \u201cNow he is who he is, and that\u2019s much more attractive.\u201d Another Republican former senator and backer, Ohio\u2019s George Voinovich, said he counseled Romney to dust himself off and keep at it. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect him to start dressing differently like Al Gore did, but to kind of relax a little bit more and speak from his heart,\u201d Voinovich said. \u201cThat\u2019s what people want. They want to know who you are, what do you believe in. He took it well.\u201d So far, Romney hasn\u2019t made the sale to everybody. One prominent Republican donor said he was prepared to sign up as a bundler, but after 45 minutes with Romney he left underwhelmed. \u201cHe\u2019s still superficial \u2014 hair in perfect shape, perfect smile, perfect family,\u201d said the donor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation. \u201cThere\u2019s something visceral about it. He can\u2019t change it.\u201d The donor said he plans to sign up as a bundler for Perry.  Romney, meanwhile, is focused on his turnaround. Asked what lessons he learned from his defeat in Iowa, he quipped: \u201cI liked winning better than losing.\u201d Then he reflected, as much as any guarded politician reflects. \u201cI don\u2019t have the key to telling you specifically what I could\u2019ve done differently other than stand for what you believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the people support you, great, and if they don\u2019t, then there are other people they can choose.\u201d ruckerp@washpost.com Staff writer Karen Tumulty in Washington contributed to this report.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 17:38:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsreturning-to-iowa-a-wiser-mitt-romney-avoids-his-past-mistakes20110808giqackdo7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 21, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:18", "headline": "Pawlenty gets Iowans fired up on eve of Republican debate", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/tim-pawlenty-gets-iowans-fired-up-on-eve-of-republican-debate/2011/08/10/gIQAxFVD8I_story.html?wprss=rss_politics", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tAMES, Iowa \u2014 One of the most oft-repeated lines heading into Thursday\u2019s Republican presidential debate and Saturday\u2019s closely watched Ames straw poll is that, on the campaign trail in Iowa, Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.) has the most passion and former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty has the best organization. But on Wednesday it was Bachmann whose campaign event looked a little staged, and Pawlenty who drew more excitement, with an early-evening rally here featuring live rock music, a rousing speech by his wife, Mary, and a cheering crowd of more than 100 supporters. Just after 7 p.m., Pawlenty walked off the RV in which he has crisscrossed Iowa for much of the past month and into the arms of a waiting crowd at Zeke\u2019s, a performing-arts hall in Ames. Wearing jeans and a brown shirt and hoarse from his marathon campaign schedule, Pawlenty ran through his talking points for the sixth time of the day and then mingled easily with supporters for more than an hour. His earlier appearances featured small but engaged crowds across western Iowa, in a pizza joint or a diner, for instance, where he answered every  question before moving on. \u201cI\u2019m kind of disappointed that he hasn\u2019t taken off in the polls, being so close to Iowa,\u201d said Doug Peters, 54, a police officer who came out with his wife and son to hear Pawlenty speak at Cronk's Cafe in Denison. \u201cBut I was impressed with his answers.\u201d Bachmann held a single public event Wednesday at Competitive Edge, a local printing and promotions company in the Des Moines suburb of Clive. The event did not attract an outside crowd and was attended only by members of the media and about 50 employees of the company. Bachmann was lively and poised, but the audience was subdued; one of the few signs of enthusiasm came from the campaign operative working the sound board, where he played an extremely loud sequence of John Philip Sousa marches as well as Elvis Presley\u2019s \u201cPromised Land\u201d and \u201cA Little Less Conversation.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t really taken a position yet,\u201d said Lee Black, 40, an art director at Competitive Edge who listened to Bachmann and said he plans to vote in the straw poll. \u201cI was really impressed, but I haven\u2019t made a judgment.\" Bachmann and Pawlenty are among eight candidates who will participate in Thursday\u2019s debate; nine Republicans will appear on the straw poll ballot. The GOP field's current front-runner, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, and Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.) are both expected to perform well Saturday, even though Romney won\u2019t even attend the event. The straw poll has become widely viewed as a make-or-break moment for Pawlenty and an important one for Bachmann: He has lagged well back in all polls, despite starting the year with high expectations, while she is looking to hold her place among the top tier of the field, carrying the good start to her campaign into the fall. More broadly, the event is seen as an important test of candidates\u2019 organizational strength in advance of the critical, first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses early next year. Bachmann and Pawlenty have been working harder than any others in Iowa in recent weeks \u2014 although Paul is close behind. Both hail from Minnesota, and both are appealing to the same fiscal and Christian conservatives through a searing critique of President Obama\u2019s leadership and regular professions of their own deep faith. But while Bachmann typically makes a more passionate plea and incites deep loyalty among her followers, Pawlenty has slowly and methodically built an organization that he hopes will outweigh her appeal. On Wednesday at Zeke\u2019s, even Pawlenty\u2019s national political director, Jon Seaton, was gathering signatures from supporters to help draw them out to the straw poll Saturday. And Adam Meinecke, 20, a member of the College Republicans at nearby Iowa State University, said he would definitely vote for Pawlenty at the poll because the candidate had called him personally. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing when the actual candidate calls me at work, not a recording, and asks me to come to the straw poll and support him,\u201d Meinecke said. \u201cI get a real feeling from him. He feels like one of us.\u201d Most Pawlenty supporters like Bachmann, too, and some in attendance said they still hadn\u2019t decided. That was true at the Bachmann event earlier in the day, where even the host, Competitive Edge owner David Greenspon, said he was not necessarily voting for Bachmann. \u201cShe\u2019s bright,\u201d Greenspon said. \u201cShe connects well with people.\u201d  But, he said, \u201cI will never agree with anybody who won\u2019t compromise.\u201d gardnera@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 03:22:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticstim-pawlenty-gets-iowans-fired-up-on-eve-of-republican-debate20110810giqaxfvd8i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 23, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 2, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:18", "headline": "Census shows surge in gay couples in D.C. area; officials cite more honesty", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/census-shows-surge-in-gay-couples-in-dc-area-officials-cite-more-honesty-on-forms/2011/08/10/gIQATYub7I_story.html?wprss=rss_politics", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tThe number of people who identify themselves as part of a same-sex couple has soared over the past decade in what demographers say is the product of an aggressive outreach effort by the Census Bureau and growing cultural acceptance. Census figures released Thursday show 17,000 same-sex couples live in Maryland, a 51\u00a0percent increase over a decade ago. That accounts for 1.5\u00a0percent of couples in the state, including married couples and heterosexual partners living together. In Virginia, the census counted 20,500 same-sex couples, a 49\u00a0percent increase that amounts to 1.2\u00a0percent of couples in the state. In both states, the number of heterosexual married couples increased only modestly. The census did not ask people for their sexual orientation, but people were asked about their relationships. In 1990, when the census added unmarried partner as an option but gave no instructions, relatively few same-sex couples checked it. The number went up slightly in 2000. Then, in the 2010 , the agency formed partnerships with gay and lesbian groups to help encourage people to correctly categorize their relationship and to assure them that information provided to the census is confidential. As a result, demographers don\u2019t think the actual number of gay couples has increased as dramatically as the numbers suggest. Rather, it reflects more same-sex couples being honest about who they are. \u201cThe bulk of the change is people acknowledging it,\u201d said Gary Gates, a demographer with the Williams Institute, a UCLA think tank that specializes in gay legal and policy issues. \u201cIndicating your relationship on a census form is one way of suggesting people are more open about it. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re terribly out in their community.\u201d In Maryland and Virginia, most of the same-sex couples live in urban neighborhoods. Baltimore and Richmond show the highest levels, and the Washington suburbs are close behind. In some Baltimore neighborhoods, as many as 14 percent of couples are gay and lesbian. Near Washington, the biggest percentages of gay and lesbian couples are in neighborhoods around Takoma Park, Rosslyn, College Park, Cheverly and parts of Alexandria. The Alexandria Gay and Lesbian Community Association, for example, is so active in civic affairs that it hosts an annual barbecue for the city\u2019s firefighters, police and EMTs. The census shows that gay and lesbian couples are present in every county in both states. And gay families with minor children were counted in every jurisdiction except for one sparsely-populated Virginia county near the West Virginia border. Though their numbers are smaller, gay and lesbian couples with children show up at higher rates in many rural areas. Gates said that is because many of them had an earlier relationship and child with someone of the opposite sex. \u201cIt\u2019s more common in socially conservative areas where people tend to come out later,\u201d he said. \u201cThe irony is that socially conservative areas create more gay families.\u201d As gay couples are more frank about their relationships, society at large is becoming more accepting of homosexuals. Chris Megargee and Barbara McKeefery, who have been together for 24 years and are now grandmothers, said they have always been treated warmly by their neighbors, both in Cape St. Clair outside Annapolis, where they raised two boys, and on Kent Island, where they now live. \u201cWe were the first gay people most of them had ever met in person,\u201d said McKeefery, 59, an optician. \u201cWe live a golden life,\u201d said Megargee, 58, who runs a promotions company from her home. \u201cAmong the people we deal with in our daily lives \u2014 our families, at work and in our neighborhood \u2014 we are treated just like anyone else in modern-day America. We are very open about who we are, and we have no issues or concerns whatsoever.\u201d Tony Curtis and his partner, Dan Dycus, have lived for eight years in Accokeek in Prince George\u2019s County, where black church leaders fought vigorously against a statewide same-sex marriage bill that was defeated. According to the census data, Curtis and Dycus are among almost 2,500 same-sex couples in Prince George\u2019s County \u2014 almost as many as the larger Montgomery County. Almost all of the residents in the development where they live on a cul de sac are African American, and Dycus, who is white, became president of the homeowners association a few years ago. \u201cEveryone has been so nice to us,\u201d said Curtis, 47, who heads a company in the commercial real estate industry. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it reflects how they feel about us. But we\u2019ve never had a problem with any of our neighbors.\u201d District figures will be released next week. Sociologists think that most gay couples decide where to live depending on factors that have nothing to do with laws and politics. \u201cWe\u2019re not any different than a straight couple,\u201d said Cary Jagur, president of the Alexandria Gay and Lesbian Community Association. \u201cWe live where we can afford, where it\u2019s reasonable to work, where there are good schools if you have children and where it\u2019s close to shopping amenities. All the things our parents looked for.\u201d But Alison Page and her partner, Leanne Wells, left Virginia when they moved from Centreville to Laurel in 2004 after they decided to have children. Paige gave birth to twins in 2006, and Wells adopted them. \u201cWe knew we wanted to have children, so we moved before we started the process,\u201d said Page, 37. \u201cThe state of Virginia would not allow second-parent adoptions for same-sex couples. Maryland gave us the legal protection we needed. We\u2019ll probably move within five years, and probably within Maryland.\u201d Maryland\u2019s census numbers were seized on by both opponents and supporters of same-sex marriage, who are planning another push in next year\u2019s legislative session, this time with assistance from Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D). Del. Michael J. Hough (R-Frederick) said the  numbers reinforce one of the arguments he and other opponents of same-sex marriage have been making. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about radically redefining marriage for what is a very, very small subset,\u201d he said. State Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr. (D-Montgomery), an openly gay man raising two children with his partner, said the statistics show how many people might choose to marry if it becomes legal. \u201cIt demonstrates that there are a significant number of same-gender families in our state, and we are everywhere in the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also shows that in the end, we\u2019re not talking about a lot of people.

But she said tougher action was required, too.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cWe urge those countries still buying Syrian oil and gas, those countries still sending Assad weapons, those countries whose political and economic support give him comfort in his brutality, to get on the right side of history,\u201d Clinton said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAssad, she said, \u201chas lost the legitimacy to lead and it is clear that Syria would be better off without him.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tU.S. officials have been trying for weeks to rally international pressure against the Syrian government, mindful that U.S. sanctions and other measures to isolate Assad have had limited effect. The United States already severely limits trade and economic ties with Syria, leaving it little leverage with a leader who has aligned himself with U.S. archrival Iran and rebuffed the administration\u2019s engagement efforts.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe strategy has been to lean on governments, such as those in Europe, to enact tougher punishments on individuals and companies close to Assad so that pressure mounts for a halt to the violence. Activists say more than 1,700 people have been killed in five months of unrest.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClinton didn\u2019t mention countries by name. But in an interview Thursday with CBS, she called for European governments to sanction Syria\u2019s oil and gas industry, and said India and China should reevaluate their energy investments in the country. And she said Russia should stop selling weapons to Assad.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cThe Assad regime\u2019s continued brutality is galvanizing international opinion,\u201d Clinton told reporters Friday after a meeting with Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere. She said countries must \u201cturn this growing consensus into increased pressure\u201d so that Assad pulls back his security forces from restive cities and begins a serious democratic transition.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClinton suggested tougher international action might come soon and said the tougher global approach toward Syria was necessary \u201cso there will not be any temptation on the part of anyone inside the Assad regime to claim that it is only the United States, or maybe it\u2019s only the West.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cIndeed, it\u2019s the entire world,\u201d she said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Europe, the Netherlands said governments may decide in the next week or two to broaden sanctions, possibly through an expanded travel ban and restrictions on the energy sector. Syria gets about 28 percent of its revenue from the oil trade, and sells fuel to France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe European Union has been reluctant to ban Syrian oil and gas imports for fear that shortages might hurt the Syrian public and small businesses.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCopyright 2011 The Associated Press.

Penney Co. reported a flat second-quarter profit on Friday as the department store retailer aggressively marked down prices on fashions to get its middle income shoppers to keep spending in an increasingly uncertain economy.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe company also issued third-quarter profit guidance that fell well below Wall Street estimates and said back-to-school shopping is starting later this year. It declined to offer a full-year outlook amid stock market turmoil fueled by fear about the economy and the downgrade of the federal debt.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cConsumer climate is clearly uncertain and the tumultuous last 10 days or so hasn\u2019t given our core customer, the middle income family, any reason to be more confident,\u201d said Myron E. Ullman, III, Penney\u2019s CEO, in an address to investors during a conference call Friday.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter tumbling as much as 4 percent, shares clawed their way back to within a quarter of where they were to start the day.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPenney, like many stores catering to middle-to-lower-income shoppers, faces increasing uncertainty heading into the two most important retail seasons of the year \u2014 back-to-school and the winter holiday season.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStores are passing along higher prices on clothing to offset rising raw material costs. Still, with anxiety rising over a potential double-dip recession, the ability of retailers to raise prices going forward could fade fast. The Standard & Poor\u2019s downgrade of federal debt a week ago has increased turbulence in the stock market and rattled consumer confidence.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore evidence of a schizophrenic economy emerged Friday.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe government reported that consumers spent more on autos, furniture and gasoline in July, pushing up retail sales by the largest amount in four months. At the same time, a survey on consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in more than 30 years. And a separate report showed that businesses increased their stockpiles in July by the smallest amount since May 2010.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor Penney, it was a flat three months.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe company reported net income of $14 million, or 7 cents per share, for the three months ended July 30. That compares with $14 million, or 6 cents per share, a year ago.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRevenue fell to $3.91 billion from $3.94 billion in the year-ago period largely reflecting the company\u2019s discontinuation of its catalog business. Revenue at stores opened at least a year, a key measure of a retailer\u2019s health, rose 1.5 percent for the quarter.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnalysts had expected earnings of 10 cents a share on revenue of $3.91 billion for the quarter, according to Factset.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPenney said that gross margins declined to 38.3 percent in the quarter from 39.4 percent in the year-ago period as it was forced to promote more aggressively early in the quarter. However, Ullman said the company has made strides in cutting expenses and improving sales productivity in the stores.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLike many department stores, J.C. Penney has been expanding its assortment of exclusive merchandise. Last year, it became the only U.S. retailer to sell Liz Claiborne and Claiborne women\u2019s wear. It\u2019s also the only department store selling MNG by Mango, a European clothing chain.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPenney has cut costs by closing some stores, outlets and a call center.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDuring the conference call with investors on Friday, Penney executives said that while exclusive fashion brands have done well, basics have been weak.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cI think the customers in this economic environment have just decided to slow down the routine purchasing, and they are focused on fashion and prices points\u201d that fit into their budget, Ullman said.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAugust, which is when back-to-school selling starts in earnest, is expected by company officials to come in below its quarterly sales forecast of up between 2 percent and 3 percent. The measure is based on revenue at stores opened at least a year. Penney said that September should be in line with the estimate and October should be a bit above.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUllman said that consumers are increasingly putting off back-to-school shopping, either waiting for even better deals or spending only when they have run out of time before school.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat\u2019s why Penney delayed its back-to-school campaign by a week.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe gross margin rate is expected to be down slightly for the same period compared with the year ago.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPenney, based in Plano, Tex., expects earnings per share to be in the range of 15 cents to 20 cents for the third quarter. Analysts had expected 27 cents per share.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShares less than a percent to $6.58 in afternoon trading.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCopyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch met Wall Street analysts and the press via conference call Wednesday for the first time since appearing before a committee of the British Parliament on July 19 to answer questions about the phone hacking scandal hatched by his company\u2019s British tabloid paper, News of the World. Then: Murdoch, 80, looked doddering and abashed and sounded foggy when asked for details about what went on at News of the World and what his company, News Corp., did about it. When he wasn\u2019t mumbling or offering monosyllabic answers to lawmakers\u2019 questions, he was deferring to his son, James, to explain how the newspaper\u2019s reporters  and investigators broke into the phone accounts of hundreds of British citizens. Murdoch\u2019s most memorable sound bite that day: \u201cThis is the most humble day of my life.\u201d Wednesday: Murdoch sounded something like his old self, the swashbuckling empire builder and chief executive of a $33 billion-a-year company. His answers to arcane financial questions on the quarterly conference call were crisp and assured. His most memorable sound bite: \u201cOur [TV] ratings are improving just about everywhere you look!\u201d  And so the man who three weeks ago couldn\u2019t remember much about illegal behavior that stretched over four years, sent two employees to jail and led to the arrest of nearly a dozen others, involved police bribes and cratered News Corp.\u2019s $12 billion attempt to buy a British satellite company on Wednesday detailed many things about his sprawling business empire.  Murdoch held forth about stock buybacks, his British printing operations and the depressed environment for Australian retailers. He said that \u201cRise of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d released by News Corp.\u2019s 20th Century Fox studio, was the box-office champ last week and that the animated \u201cRio\u201d (also Fox) will be out on DVD next week. When one analyst on the call suggested that News Corp.\u2019s Fox Business Channel was something of a laggard, Murdoch was quick to its defense.\u201cIts ratings are, in fact,  improving,\u201d he said. \u201cAt certain times of the day, where we are head-to-head with CNBC, we are beating them. We do need more distribution, it\u2019s true. But on a cash basis, it\u2019s break even.\u201d He had little to say about the hacking scandal. \u201cWe\u2019re trying very hard,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, we have to get to the bottom of what happened. .\u2009.\u2009. We\u2019re cooperating 100 percent, totally,  with police in their investigations. We expect that to pay off in some time.\u201d Murdoch expressed full confidence in James Murdoch, who runs News Corp.\u2019s British operations. James Murdoch has until Thursday to submit written replies to Parliament to follow up on his testimony last month. A parliamentary committee is looking into claims by two former News Corp. executives that they had told the younger Murdoch about the extent of the hacking back in 2008, despite James Murdoch\u2019s testimony that he was unaware of how far it had spread when he approved a million-dollar settlement with one of the victims that year. As for himself, Rupert Murdoch said firmly, \u201cThe board and I believe I should continue in my current role as chairman and CEO.\u201d News Corp. allotted just seven minutes for press questions, sparing Murdoch the kind of grilling he got in London. farhip@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 17:06:34", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlifestylestylerupert-murdoch-of-news-corp-is-back-to-his-swashbuckling-self20110810giqanyxl7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 29, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Census shows surge in gay couples in D.C. area; officials cite more honesty", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/census-shows-surge-in-gay-couples-in-dc-area-officials-cite-more-honesty-on-forms/2011/08/10/gIQATYub7I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tThe number of people who identify themselves as part of a same-sex couple has soared over the past decade in what demographers say is the product of an aggressive outreach effort by the Census Bureau and growing cultural acceptance. Census figures released Thursday show 17,000 same-sex couples live in Maryland, a 51\u00a0percent increase over a decade ago. That accounts for 1.5\u00a0percent of couples in the state, including married couples and heterosexual partners living together. In Virginia, the census counted 20,500 same-sex couples, a 49\u00a0percent increase that amounts to 1.2\u00a0percent of couples in the state. In both states, the number of heterosexual married couples increased only modestly. The census did not ask people for their sexual orientation, but people were asked about their relationships. In 1990, when the census added unmarried partner as an option but gave no instructions, relatively few same-sex couples checked it. The number went up slightly in 2000. Then, in the 2010 , the agency formed partnerships with gay and lesbian groups to help encourage people to correctly categorize their relationship and to assure them that information provided to the census is confidential. As a result, demographers don\u2019t think the actual number of gay couples has increased as dramatically as the numbers suggest. Rather, it reflects more same-sex couples being honest about who they are. \u201cThe bulk of the change is people acknowledging it,\u201d said Gary Gates, a demographer with the Williams Institute, a UCLA think tank that specializes in gay legal and policy issues. \u201cIndicating your relationship on a census form is one way of suggesting people are more open about it. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re terribly out in their community.\u201d In Maryland and Virginia, most of the same-sex couples live in urban neighborhoods. Baltimore and Richmond show the highest levels, and the Washington suburbs are close behind. In some Baltimore neighborhoods, as many as 14 percent of couples are gay and lesbian. Near Washington, the biggest percentages of gay and lesbian couples are in neighborhoods around Takoma Park, Rosslyn, College Park, Cheverly and parts of Alexandria. The Alexandria Gay and Lesbian Community Association, for example, is so active in civic affairs that it hosts an annual barbecue for the city\u2019s firefighters, police and EMTs. The census shows that gay and lesbian couples are present in every county in both states. And gay families with minor children were counted in every jurisdiction except for one sparsely-populated Virginia county near the West Virginia border. Though their numbers are smaller, gay and lesbian couples with children show up at higher rates in many rural areas. Gates said that is because many of them had an earlier relationship and child with someone of the opposite sex. \u201cIt\u2019s more common in socially conservative areas where people tend to come out later,\u201d he said. \u201cThe irony is that socially conservative areas create more gay families.\u201d As gay couples are more frank about their relationships, society at large is becoming more accepting of homosexuals. Chris Megargee and Barbara McKeefery, who have been together for 24 years and are now grandmothers, said they have always been treated warmly by their neighbors, both in Cape St. Clair outside Annapolis, where they raised two boys, and on Kent Island, where they now live. \u201cWe were the first gay people most of them had ever met in person,\u201d said McKeefery, 59, an optician. \u201cWe live a golden life,\u201d said Megargee, 58, who runs a promotions company from her home. \u201cAmong the people we deal with in our daily lives \u2014 our families, at work and in our neighborhood \u2014 we are treated just like anyone else in modern-day America. We are very open about who we are, and we have no issues or concerns whatsoever.\u201d Tony Curtis and his partner, Dan Dycus, have lived for eight years in Accokeek in Prince George\u2019s County, where black church leaders fought vigorously against a statewide same-sex marriage bill that was defeated. According to the census data, Curtis and Dycus are among almost 2,500 same-sex couples in Prince George\u2019s County \u2014 almost as many as the larger Montgomery County. Almost all of the residents in the development where they live on a cul de sac are African American, and Dycus, who is white, became president of the homeowners association a few years ago. \u201cEveryone has been so nice to us,\u201d said Curtis, 47, who heads a company in the commercial real estate industry. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it reflects how they feel about us. But we\u2019ve never had a problem with any of our neighbors.\u201d District figures will be released next week. Sociologists think that most gay couples decide where to live depending on factors that have nothing to do with laws and politics. \u201cWe\u2019re not any different than a straight couple,\u201d said Cary Jagur, president of the Alexandria Gay and Lesbian Community Association. \u201cWe live where we can afford, where it\u2019s reasonable to work, where there are good schools if you have children and where it\u2019s close to shopping amenities. All the things our parents looked for.\u201d But Alison Page and her partner, Leanne Wells, left Virginia when they moved from Centreville to Laurel in 2004 after they decided to have children. Paige gave birth to twins in 2006, and Wells adopted them. \u201cWe knew we wanted to have children, so we moved before we started the process,\u201d said Page, 37. \u201cThe state of Virginia would not allow second-parent adoptions for same-sex couples. Maryland gave us the legal protection we needed. We\u2019ll probably move within five years, and probably within Maryland.\u201d Maryland\u2019s census numbers were seized on by both opponents and supporters of same-sex marriage, who are planning another push in next year\u2019s legislative session, this time with assistance from Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D). Del. Michael J. Hough (R-Frederick) said the  numbers reinforce one of the arguments he and other opponents of same-sex marriage have been making. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about radically redefining marriage for what is a very, very small subset,\u201d he said. State Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr. (D-Montgomery), an openly gay man raising two children with his partner, said the statistics show how many people might choose to marry if it becomes legal. \u201cIt demonstrates that there are a significant number of same-gender families in our state, and we are everywhere in the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also shows that in the end, we\u2019re not talking about a lot of people. The other side\u2019s predictions of doom and gloom are oversized.\u201d Del. Heather R. Mizeur (D-Montgomery), a gay lawmaker who has a wife, said the census numbers show the changing face of what is now considered family. \u201cThere are 9,000 Maryland children that have two moms or two dads, that are looking to the General Assembly and saying, \u2018Protect my family, like everyone else\u2019s,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. morelloc@washpost.com mellnikt@washpost.com Staff Writer John Wagner contributed to this report.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 21:01:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocalcensus-shows-surge-in-gay-couples-in-dc-area-officials-cite-more-honesty-on-forms20110810giqatyub7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 33, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 09:56:11", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "O\u2019Malley: Tax increases still on table", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/maryland-politics/post/omalley-tax-increases-still-on-table/2011/08/11/gIQAfBrR8I_blog.html?wprss=maryland-politics", "content": "<p>Gov.

Consumers spent more than they had in four months. But a survey that measures consumer confidence fell to a 30-year low. Shoppers may not want to spend much if they are worried about their jobs and a diving stock market.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, uneasiness about the health of major economies of countries that use the euro kept a lid on the common currency, despite the gain in European stock markets after regulators moved to protect shares of European financial companies from investors who want to sell them.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrance, Europe\u2019s second biggest economy, said on Friday that economic growth was flat in the second quarter, suggesting that it may have to cut government spending even more deeply. Investors have been scared by speculation that France may lose its AAA credit rating.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe euro gained to $1.4241 from $1.4216 in afternoon trading. The British pound rose to $1.6281 from $1.6213, while the dollar dipped to 76.75 Japanese yen from 76.83 yen.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the U.S. currency added to its sharp climb this week against the Swiss franc.

Across the military region of Hampton Roads, neighbors often suspected that the confident, supremely fit young neighbor who mowed the lawn one day and disappeared the next for weeks at a time might be a Navy SEAL, or a member of some other elite commando team.  But few knew for certain until Saturday, when the terrible news arrived that 30 Americans \u2014 including 22 Navy SEALs \u2014 had died in Afghanistan after Taliban forces shot down their helicopter. Some were members of SEAL Team Six based here at Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base.  Now members of the community are grappling with how to mourn and honor the sacrifice of those whose lives have been shielded in the strictest secrecy, and how to serve the families they left behind. \u201cMany times, you\u2019re stationed somewhere where you have no family, so we become each other\u2019s family,\u201d said Angela Boothe, who lives across the cul de sac from the light gray house with blue shutters where Stephen Matthew Mills, 35, lived with his wife, Keri, and their toddler son, Cash.  (Mills, 35, who grew up in Texas, also has two children from a previous marriage.) Two weeks before Mills\u2019s last deployment, Boothe, whose husband is in the Navy, said she and her 18-year-old son, Christopher, met at Mills\u2019s garage sale. Her son told Mills of his interest in attending the U.S. Naval Academy or becoming a SEAL. Mills never let on that he was a SEAL, but he offered to help the young man prepare himself.   \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ve trained with them. I know their workout,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Boothe said. \u201cThey hit it off.\u201d  On Saturday, Boothe said she returned to pay her respects to Mills\u2019s widow. Boothe said the Millses\u2019 house was full of food, relatives and Navy comrades who tried to keep the mood uplifting, to ride out the recurring waves of grief. \u201cEveryone was talking to her and reminding her of the good times she had with him. Every time she broke down, saying \u2018Who\u2019s going to take care of Cash? Who\u2019s going to teach him to play ball?\u2019 they\u2019d say, \u2018We will.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Boothe recalled Monday, as she prepared to make a pan of lasagna for the Millses. \u201cFrom what I saw, they were great people.\u201d A fleet of SUVs and pickups with out-of-state plates still filled the driveway, and a delivery notice from a florist hung on the door. A young man with a tribal tattoo who said he was Mills\u2019s best friend and colleague turned away a reporter from the door.  The mood seemed especially dark in contrast to the pride and jubilation that swept over Hampton Roads a few months ago when people celebrated the Navy SEALs as hometown heroes \u2014 perhaps too publicly, some say \u2014 for killing Osama Bin Laden. Saturday\u2019s crash, the worst single loss of American life since the conflict in Afghanistan began nearly 10 years ago, has also forced even the most gung-ho and patriotic to reassess the wisdom of the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan.  Though the Pentagon has not yet identified the dead, some families have received notification and shared accounts of their loved ones with news media or created memorial pages on Facebook, and word spread in their home towns. Yet, with few public ceremonies in Hampton Roads to recognize the sacrifice of the service members, the most powerful expressions of mourning in this military community have occurred quietly in some of the suburban neighborhoods where SEALS lived. Neighbors have rallied around the survivors in subtle, muted ways, following instincts that come from prior military service or life in a military family. They put out an American flag, sometimes at half staff. They mow the widow\u2019s yard. They knock at the door with home-baked lasagna, brownies and other comfort foods. They offer to babysit the children or run errands.   Such expressions of grief, suffused with the values of stoicism and decorum, attempt to navigate an emotionally charged contradiction: Even in death, the SEALs and their families often shun the attention that many want to give them. Neighbors often struggle to find the right balance between showing their concern and protecting their neighbors\u2019 privacy. Even if they had not known the SEAL or the SEAL\u2019s family for very long, or not at all, many neighbors express a patriotic duty to show their appreciation, to care for the families who have suffered.  Others say they want to bear witness to the heroics of those who died, but they are circumspect, too, reluctant to divulge the most ordinary recollection because of the SEALs\u2019 ethos of complete secrecy. A retiree who lives next door to Mills was not sure she should talk about the time Mills pruned a crepe myrtle in her yard after he learned that neither she nor her husband could reach the top of it.  The city, whose economy thrives on the military presence, has also been discreet. Though Mayor William D. Sessoms Jr. has ordered flags flown at half staff on city buildings, there have been no makeshift memorials, no yellow ribbon campaigns or public prayer services\u2014 as the military  prefers, Sessoms said.  \u201cThe low-key response is because that\u2019s what we were asked: \u2018Give us space. Give us time to mourn. We know you\u2019re there for us,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Sessoms said. On Tuesday night, a rare public memorial took place when surfers formed a ritual circle in the sea for Kraig Vickers, one of the fallen SEALs who was a Hawaii native and loved to surf. But organizers of the paddle-out off Little Island Fishing Pier in Sandbridge also asked that there be no interviews, the Virginian-Pilot reported. Another public tribute occurred hours after the helicopter crash with a moment of silence during a Norfolk Tides minor league baseball game.  At the Vickerses\u2019 home in a quiet suburban development, the family declined a request for an interview. Neighbors tried to comprehend the loss of a man who left behind his pregnant wife Nani and their three children.  Pat Sullivan, a retired Defense Department civilian, said he wanted to fly a flag on his  house in Vickers\u2019 honor, though he wasn\u2019t sure if he should fly it at half staff. He also baked brownies.  His wife, Rhoni, 46, said she has already thought that she will offer Vickers\u2019s widow the opportunity to use their time-share condo at a beach in Florida. They did not know the Vickers well or socialize, and so she felt reluctant to visit right away. She said other neighbors have cut the grass or taken the children swimming.  \u201cThey have three kids, and one on the way,\u201d Rhoni said. \u201cHow do we, as a community, take care of that family that has sacrificed so much for us?\u201d kunklef@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 12:02:15", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocalva-community-struggles-with-how-to-honor-seals-shot-down-in-afghanistan20110810giqa0zjw6i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 48, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "How a D.C. area family with 11 children, ages 12 through 1, makes it work", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/how-a-dc-area-family-with-11-children-ages-12-through-1-makes-it-work/2011/07/26/gIQAROAk6I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tLike other mothers, Jen Kilmer makes sure all her children are accounted for before pulling away in the car. Her routine begins with a cheer:  Mom: \u201cAre we ready?\u201d Kids: \u201cYes, we are!\u201d Mom: \u201cKilmer family .\u2009.\u2009.\u201d All: \u201cRah, rah, rah!\u201d Then the roll call begins: Christina (\u201cHere!\u201d), Joe (\u201cHere!\u201d), Michelle (\u201cHere!\u201d), Julie (\u201cHere!\u201d), Tommy (\u201cHere!\u201d), Steven (\u201cHere!\u201d), Matthew (\u201cHere!\u201d), John Paul (\u201cHere!\u201d), Larry (\u201cHere!\u201d), Rosemary (\u201cHere!\u201d), Peter (with help from older siblings, \u201cHere!\u201d).  Yep, Jen Kilmer has 11 children. They range in age from 12 to 1. No twins or triplets, but six sets of children born less than a year apart. With the average U.S. family household having less than one child, according to the 2010 Census, the Kilmer family is clearly an anomaly. And the family\u2019s day-to-day life is one many of us would find unmanageable.  Yet Jen, 45, a stay-at-home mom, and husband Larry, 53, a high school teacher, make it work. And despite years of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion, the Rockville family says they\u2019re having fun. \u201cWe\u2019re laughing a lot,\u201d says Jen. \u201cAnd within minutes, we can have a family soccer game. Not many families can say that.\u201d Not many families can say they need a 15-passenger van to go places together either. Or that they get mistaken for a day-care group when they go to a restaurant. Or that they go through two gallons of milk and two loaves of bread each day. Or that they spent six years with four children simultaneously in diapers. Despite the high potential for pandemonium, the Kilmer household is orderly and unchaotic. Beds are made, clothes are folded and the children help around the house.  There is no secret formula to their success, says Jen (and aside from an occasional hand from in-laws, no outside child-care help either). But clearly, keeping on top of a family this size requires superhuman doses of organization and patience. Not to mention a level of personal sacrifice beyond measure. \u201cPeople are always asking, \u2018How do you have time for yourself?\u2019\u2009\u201d says Jen. \u201cBut when you realize there\u2019s more to life than yourself .\u2009.\u2009. I think time to yourself is overrated.\u201d Jen and Larry met in 1994 when they were both teachers and soccer coaches at area Catholic high schools. Their soccer teams played each other; they married three years later.  Jen, who grew up on a small farm outside Boston with eight siblings, says she always wanted lots of kids. Larry, who was adopted and has one sibling, had no preconceived notions of family. The couple say they agreed to accept the children God sent them. Nine-and-a-half months after their wedding, their first child was born. Eleven-and-a-half months later, a second arrived. Today, the Kilmers\u2019 children are ages 12, 11, 10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3 and 1.  A day in the life During the school year, Jen\u2019s days begin at 5 a.m.  She lays out the children\u2019s uniforms, makes lunches, then attends 6:30 Mass at the Shrine at St. Jude.  After Mass, Larry and the oldest boys leave for school.  The remaining school-age children get dressed, eat breakfast, grab lunches and walk to school. The youngest stay home with Mom, who finishes up the morning routine: cleaning from breakfast, making beds and putting in a load of laundry. This fall, two of the three youngest will start preschool, adding a little wrinkle to the established morning routine.  Getting everyone off to school can be chaotic, says Jen, but she rarely feels overwhelmed by her daily to-do list.  \u201cSo many people are surprised when I say that,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe after a while you just have coping techniques.\u201d One coping technique is routine. Once Jen establishes a system that works, she\u2019s diligent about implementing it so nothing ever gets out of control, a necessity for a large family in a small house.  Family cleanup times come twice daily: right before 3 and after dinner. When mail comes through the door, it\u2019s dealt with immediately. (\u201cI never let it touch the table because it would stay there,\u201d she says.) The children\u2019s art projects are in constant rotation; artwork goes up on the fridge for a week, then gets filed away. When preparing for a family trip, she gives each child a large Ziploc bag and a detailed packing list.  She does four to five loads of laundry each day. Folded clothes get put in plastic drawers in the playroom labeled with each child\u2019s name. Twice a week, the kids bring their clothes upstairs.  The Kilmer command center is a roll-top desk that sits in the kitchen, keeping things such as mail, bills, permission slips and the laptop within arm\u2019s reach. \u201cI need to be near the command center, so it needs to be downstairs,\u201d says Jen. \u201cWhen the kids were little, when I came downstairs I wouldn\u2019t go back up until nighttime.\u201d Most of the children are home from school by 3. They have a snack and start homework while Jen begins dinner. As in many families, homework time can be stressful.  \u201cEveryone has questions, and I only have so much patience,\u201d says Jen. \u201cThe first- through fifth-graders need a lot of hand-holding.\u201d  When things get to be too much, she goes outside and sits on the back porch swing. \u201cSometimes,\u201d she says, \u201cyou just need a moment of peace.\u201d Family dinners take place around an eight-foot-long table with bench seating, recently given to them by a friend who no longer needed it. Previously, a second table had to be moved in and out of the kitchen every night.  Bedtime begins at 7:30, with the children taking shifts in their shared upstairs bathroom; some get ready for bed, others clean up downstairs.  By 9 p.m. all the children are in bed. It\u2019s the first quiet moment Jen\u2019s had since Mass more than 14 hours earlier. \u201cWhen the last one goes to bed, sometimes I sit down to relax,\u201d she says. Some nights, she\u2019ll take a 20-minute nap before tackling the rest of her work: cleaning the kitchen, more laundry and making sure uniforms are in order for the following day.  Jen credits her childhood as part of her preparation for being a mother to 11 children. \u201cEveryone had chores,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been trained to work hard. God was preparing me.\u201d Challenges Jen and Larry bought their four- (now five-) bedroom colonial when they had only one child. Moving into a bigger home now isn\u2019t financially possible, so they\u2019ve made adjustments.  They added a master bedroom suite with a bathroom and office space; the kids\u2019 rooms all have bunk beds. They moved the playroom into the larger family room area to accommodate all the toys. A wall was erected in the new family room space to prevent sound from the TV from traveling upstairs.  But a cramped house is just one of the challenges for the Kilmer family.  \u201cWe can\u2019t stay in a hotel because the ratio of children to adults is too high,\u201d says Jen. \u201cWe\u2019re considered a fire hazard.\u201d When one person gets sick, it could be a month before the virus leaves the house, she says, and one-on-one time between a parent and child, and between spouses, is limited. The biggest challenge, however, is money.  The day-to-day expenses for a family of 13 can be staggering. The Kilmers\u2019 grocery bills alone run about $300 per week. Add a mortgage, car payments, medical bills and home and auto repairs and the cost of Catholic school, and it\u2019s not surprising that some months they find it difficult to make ends meet.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have a college plan for tomorrow,\u201d says Jen, \u201cbecause we\u2019re trying to pay for the groceries today.\u201d To supplement his teaching income during the summer, Larry runs week-long sports camps and paints houses.  Jen is careful about spending, cuts coupons and find ways to work with what they have.  \u201cI recently learned [to make] soup,\u201d she says. \u201cThe kids eat veggies and I can stretch my meat.\u201d The couple say the generosity of others also helps them get by. \u201cWe\u2019ll get bags of clothing on the doorstep, and I don\u2019t even know who they\u2019re from,\u201d says Jen. People have given the family clothes, furniture, meals and grocery gift cards without being asked, says Larry.  \u201cEvery year it happens more and more,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd their generosity allows us to be generous to others.\u201d  The Kilmers frequently pass along clothing they no longer use to other families. Another wonderful lesson, they say, for the children.   Once, when most of the family was ill, word spread in the community. Within hours, family, friends, neighbors and colleagues appeared at their door to cook, clean and watch the children. For two weeks, meals were left by the front door.  Constant companions On a recent rainy Monday afternoon, Jen picks up the older children from soccer camp; the little ones, Larry, Rosemary (whom they call Rosie) and Peter, are with her. When she arrives at the camp, the oldest eight climb into the van, tousling the baby\u2019s hair and giving their mom a play-by-play of the day. From their car seats, 3-year-old Rosie and 1-year-old Peter are holding hands.  Later, as Jen prepares dinner, the six older boys, ages 4 through 11, have a lively Wii competition while Julie, 10, helps Rosie practice writing her name at the kitchen table and the older girls play with Peter. When Peter has had enough indoor play, Joe, 11, takes him for a walk around the neighborhood in the stroller.  \u201cYou always have someone to play with,\u201d says Michelle, 10, about the benefits of having many brothers and sisters.  \u201cYou\u2019re never bored,\u201d says Christina, 12. \u201cWhen you\u2019re close in age with someone, you have best friends.\u201d  Besides having built-in buddies, Jen says having so many siblings teaches the children leadership, teamwork, waiting their turn and helping one another.  \u201cI feel very strongly that the best gift you can give a child is a sibling,\u201d she says.  The rock of Faith Jen recalls the days when the family had seven children younger than 7.  \u201cI had to do everything for them from tying everyone\u2019s shoes to buckling them all into their car seats,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s when I just really felt exhausted.\u201d She admits to crying sometimes under the weight of it all. But those \u201cpity parties\u201d are short-lived. \u201cI can only feel sorry for myself for so long because there is work to be done,\u201d she says.  In the midst of the stress and commotion, the constant chorus of \u201cMom!\u201d and the backbreaking pace, Jen remains calm and cheerful. It\u2019s evident that part of what gives her peace as well as the confidence of knowing it will all work out is her Catholic faith. \u201cSomehow God provides,\u201d she often says, \u201cin ways you don\u2019t even know.\u201d That faith guides the children as well. When he grows up, Tommy, 9, says he wants to be \u201ca professional basketball player and a priest.\u201d  \u201cIf I am a professional basketball player,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll do that, retire and then become a priest.\u201d  When asked if more children are in their future, Jen mentions her age and says, \u201cProbably not, but we would love to. We would accept whatever comes.\u201d  Chat live: Wondering how Jen Kilmer does it? Ask her yourself when she chats with staff writer Terri Sapienza about what life is like with 11 kids.

She speaks calmly as she sits in a high-backed, dark wooden chair in her spacious Baltimore office, a master bureaucrat.

One look at her r\u00e9sum\u00e9shows she\u2019s spent a lifetime mastering the minutia of process and regulation on behalf of the elderly, the ill and the disabled at the Social Security Administration and other organizations. Social Security Commissioner Michael J. Astrue appointed Braunstein director of a program called Compassionate Allow\u00adances in 2007 after she helped him about 20 years earlier when his terminally ill father could not quickly obtain benefits. The two were working together at the Department of Health and Human Services. Astrue\u2019s father developed glioblastoma, an often-fatal brain cancer that resulted in a coma. Astrue found himself trying to file for benefits on behalf of someone who wasn\u2019t able to speak. \u201cIt was a huge surprise and a time of high anxiety,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving someone as competent as Diane was a great blessing.\u201d This year, Braunstein was named one of four finalists for the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal after Compassionate Allowances cut waiting times for the approval of disability benefits from months to an average of two weeks for thousands of people. The Service to America medals are awarded annually to government workers by Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group. Accelerated benefits were approved for about 45,000 people in 2010 through Compassionate Allowances. The SSA is expecting about 20,000 more this year. Braunstein can sum up her life\u2019s work simply: \u201cIt\u2019s about a commitment to public service.\u201d She said it\u2019s not uncommon for people with rare or terminal diseases to become burdened with a slew of more paperwork from the SSA. \u201cThe temptation is to keep asking for more and more evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cIt actually slows down the approval of the benefit.\u201d When Astrue\u2019s father was afflicted with glioblastoma, Braunstein helped Astrue navigate the system, using her inside knowledge to show him quick and efficient ways of getting benefits. Astrue said the idea for Compassionate Allowances arose partly from his experiences. The program started to take form in 2007, when he appointed Braunstein as director. Braunstein and the SSA then worked to build a list of 100 illnesses that would qualify for accelerated processing times through the program. Most diseases on the list are rare, hard to treat and terminal, such as early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease and acute leukemia. The SSA held public hearings to find the diseases that would fit the bill for a compassionate allowance. \u201cThe things you find remarkable are the people who come forward to testify,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had a dad come and testify about having lost his child to cancer. .\u2009.\u2009. People\u2019s interest in coming forth to improve the system even after they\u2019ve experienced great difficulty or sorrow was really very touching to me.\u201d One year later, the program was up and running. Braunstein \u201ccame in very focused,\u201d Astrue said. \u201cThere was an awful lot of detail that needed to be worked out. Given how long it takes to get things done in the federal government, she really moved this along very swiftly.\u201d Braunstein\u2019s commitment to the elderly, disabled and ill goes back much further. Her first job out of college was for a Manhattan congressman in the late 1970s, working on one of the first \u201cmeals on wheels\u201d programs for elderly and disabled residents on the East Side. There, she gained her first exposure to SSA claims, mostly dealing with such issues as misplaced checks. But when Social Security nearly went bankrupt about the same time, she sensed an opportunity. \u201cI could see the baby boom 75 years out and thought, \u2018Gee, there might be a career in there for me,\u2019\u200a\u201d she said. She wrote 60 pages of a House Ways and Means committee report for the amendments to Social Security financing in 1983. Since then, she\u2019s worked on Capitol Hill as well as for a number of private organizations, including the National Governors Association and the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. Her work has also taken her around the world, as the artwork on her office walls shows. Photos from a National Governors Association trip to Nara, Japan, hang across the room from a watercolor of Mackinac Island, Mich. She was appointed director of aging for the State of Michigan in the 1990s. She now deals with matters of Social Security overseas as associate director of the Office of International Programs, a position she was appointed to in 2009, while also keeping tabs on Compassionate Allowances occasionally, she said. It\u2019s a long title with long hours, she said. But when she isn\u2019t working, she\u2019s attending Washington Performing Arts Society events and Baltimore Symphony Orchestra performances. Her passion for the arts grew out of an interest in classical and pop music composition many years ago, she said. She was also once the stage manager for a folk festival near her home in Takoma Park. Public service work runs in the family. She remembers her mother, a member of the League of Women Voters and a teacher, taking her to volunteer at the polls during elections. \u201cThere was never an election where we didn\u2019t take people to the polls and help them to vote,\u201d she said. Braunstein grew up in New York and graduated from Kenyon College in Ohio with a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science, although, she said, \u201cin truth, it\u2019s political philosophy.\u201d \u201cI read a lot of Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, the Federalist Papers \u2014 stuff like that,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom Plato to here, it\u2019s a leap, but I was always interested in Washington and public policy.\u201d If Plato and Aristotle taught her anything about Washington, she said, it would be that history often repeats itself. \u201cThings don\u2019t change much,\u201d she said. \u201cYou think they do, but there is a lot of similarity over time.\u201d khans@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 16:15:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaldiane-braunstein-has-helped-speed-social-security-benefits-to-thousands20110729giqaypkm7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 55, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "D.C. summer jobs program finishes $6 million under budget", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-summer-jobs-program-finishes-6-million-under-budget/2011/08/10/gIQAJwSS7I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tThe cost of the District\u2019s summer jobs program is an ever-moving target, with city officials saying Wednesday that this year\u2019s program will finish $6 million under budget. At a council oversight hearing Wednesday afternoon, officials projected that the six-week program, which ended Friday, will have spent $10.8 million, but they were unable to provide a full accounting. That\u2019s millions of dollars less than the estimated cost of compensating the 14,000 participants alone \u2014 14- to 21-year-old D.C. residents who worked in government agencies and D.C. businesses and who each earned about $1,000. Curtis Lewis, chief fiscal officer of the Department of Employment Services, which runs the program, declined in an interview to elaborate on the $10.8 million figure. He said the program ran under budget because 19 percent of its participants didn\u2019t finish.  That dropout rate would leave more than 11,000 participants each earning $1,000, adding up to more than the latest budget estimate. The officials said the projected cost also includes administrative costs, such as 22 part-time staff hires, 24 employees working on the program full time, orientation sessions, site visits and an independent evaluation. Officials could not fully explain how the $6 million surplus arose nor what would happen to it.  Employment Services Director Lisa Mallory told the committee that the money would have to be spent by Sept. 30 but that she didn\u2019t know how it would be used. The program was originally budgeted at $14.4 million and was expanded to $16.8 million when the mayor added funds for an additional 2,000 participants, according to Lewis\u2019s testimony. The oversight committee\u2019s chairman, D.C. Council member Michael A. Brown (I-At Large), greeted the budget surplus as a major achievement for the often-troubled program, which in recent years has run as much as $30\u00a0million over its budget. \u201cThe 2011 program did right by the young people here in our city, but it did right by the taxpayers, as well,\u201d Brown said. After the hearing, Brown said the final spending won\u2019t be determined until the figures submitted by Mallory\u2019s agency are reviewed by the city\u2019s chief financial officer, Natwar M. Gandhi. Lewis also referred questions to Gandhi\u2019s office. A spokesman for the chief financial officer said that the numbers had not been certified and that he did not know how the amount was calculated. Mallory said the 19 percent attrition, while on a par with recent years, is something the program should improve. Still, officials and community leaders said they consider this year\u2019s program a success. There were far fewer reports of logistical problems; Brown said his office received only one complaint, compared with a flood of distressed calls and e-mails in previous summers. Trisha Taylor, a program coordinator for the Sitar Arts Center, which used summer hires, told the committee the program benefited from allowing employers to screen applicants. Rene Wallis, director of People Animals Love, said none of the 20 participants her organization selected ended up assigned there. Still, she said, this year\u2019s program was \u201clight-years better.\u201d Mallory said the program also saved costs by developing a new in-house timekeeping system, allowing her department to resolve nearly all of the 1,382 reported pay disputes within two days. arnsdorfi@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 18:26:56", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaldc-politicsdc-summer-jobs-program-finishes-6-million-under-budget20110810giqajwss7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 57, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "MLK Jr. memorial events announced", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/mlk-memorial-events-are-set/2011/08/10/gIQAghtv6I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tDistrict residents will have the chance for an exclusive tour of the new $120 million Rev.  Martin Luther King Jr.  National Memorial on Aug. 23, a day after it opens to the public and days before a star-studded dedication where President Obama is scheduled to speak. Mayor Vincent C. Gray, flanked by civil rights activists, Wednesday announced D.C. Resident Day, along with other city events that will coincide with the King memorial dedication. \u201cAll too often, when national events happen, the District of Columbia is an afterthought,\u201d Gray (D) said in an interview. \u201cWe wanted our citizens to come see this and hopefully be motivated by the memorial.\u201d Gray held a news conference at the memorial, which is still under construction. The mayor, city officials, the news media and others were allowed to peek behind scaffolding to see the 30-foot sculpture of King that stands alongside the Tidal Basin, adjacent to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial and between the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials. The King memorial is a distinguished addition because it recognizes a non-president and an African American, said Harry E. Johnson Sr., president and chief executive of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation. Johnson spoke with reverence about the memorial that has been 26 years in the making, but he also joked that King is in great company. \u201cTo put him between Lincoln and Jefferson? Location, location, location,\u201d he said. Details of how District residents can get timed special passes for the Aug. 23 viewing will be announced next week, Gray said, adding that the city did not designate Aug. 22 as the day because it is the first day of class for D.C. public school students. The process for getting passes will involve online applications and in-person requests at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library downtown. The library will recognize the memorial dedication with a series of programs getting underway Aug. 22. Naomi King \u2014 King\u2019s sister-in-law \u2014 will discuss a documentary about her husband, the Rev. Alfred Daniel Williams King, on Aug. 25. The Morehouse College Glee Club will perform at noon Aug. 27 at the library. Residents are being asked to join a rally and march for \u201cfull democracy\u201d on Aug. 27. Participants will gather on Freedom Plaza and join the national March on Washington at 17th and Constitution. Gray, who was arrested earlier this year for a protest against a federal budget vote that he believed was unfair to the District, said it was an opportune time to highlight the District\u2019s lack of voting rights and statehood. He noted that King spoke of the District\u2019s status in 1965. \u201cThat is as contemporary today as it was 45 years ago,\u201d Gray said. Other local events include an Aug. 26 reception for out-of-town elected officials hosted by Gray and the Aug. 25 dedication of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. stewartn@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 11:54:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlocaldc-politicsmlk-memorial-events-are-set20110810giqaghtv6i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 64, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Chutney: Born in Virginia, inspired by Britain", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/chutney-born-in-virginia-inspired-by-britain/2011/08/02/gIQARjro4I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tAs a kid growing up in Northern Virginia, Oliver Turner could never get a classmate to swap for the lunches his British-born mother packed for him. No kid raised on peanut butter and jelly on Wonder bread would think about trading in the tried-and-true for cheddar on brown bread, especially when the cheese was slathered with something too exotic to be recognized. \u201cIt blew the deal when they saw the huge chunks of chutney,\u201d Turner says, ruefully. Several decades later, chutney\u2019s niche appeal doesn\u2019t pose quite as much of a challenge for Turner and his parents, who are building a family business around the stuff in Washington, Va. Shoppers at Whole Foods, the biggest retailer that carries their Virginia Chutney Co. products, don\u2019t tend to be the Wonder bread type, after all. The company has made great strides in its seven years of operation. The business sold its first jar of chutney at the Fun Shop in Middleburg and initially focused on smaller gift stores. In early 2007, it got its big break when the then-new Whole Foods in Alexandria began to stock the products. Virginia Chutney\u2019s line of mango, green tomato and a half-dozen other varieties is now carried in 128 Whole Foods stores in the Mid-Atlantic and on the West Coast, as well as such specialty cheese shops as Cowgirl Creamery in the District and Murray\u2019s in New York. But with ketchup, mustard and salsa commanding most of the nation\u2019s condiment attention, chutney can still be a hard sell. For starters, chutney aficionados don\u2019t always agree about the definition: Is chutney a relish, a sauce or something else? \u201cI say it\u2019s like a savory jam that\u2019s always made with fruit and vinegar and onions,\u201d says Clare Turner, Oliver\u2019s mother. \u201cBut there are tons of Indian ones that aren\u2019t made like that at all.\u201d Even at Whole Foods, shoppers didn\u2019t always know about pairing chutney with cheese and mostly associated it with Indian curry. Consumers in the South, where chutneys are a staple, responded more favorably when Clare Turner served samples. \u201cI found that fascinating, as I got the idea of making chutney when I did my degree in anthropology and was studying food ways and the diverse food culture of the South,\u201d she says. I was among those who\u2019d never paid much attention to chutney other than to reach for a dab of Major Grey\u2019s, a sweet mango chutney, to tame the fire of Indian food. But in the United Kingdom, chutney is a sweet-and-savory standard that\u2019s put out with cheese or a roast or almost any dish that might benefit from a little extra zing. \u201cI think the food in England used to be so awful, they put chutney on everything,\u201d Clare says. Actually, the Brits \u201cdiscovered\u201d chutney during the colonial period in India and brought the concept back home, where recipes incorporated local fruits and accommodated sweeter tastes, says her son. But the most famous Brit associated with chutney \u2014 Major Grey \u2014 wasn\u2019t even a real person. \u201cMajor Grey was an apocryphal character created to reflect the interplay between English and Indian food cultures,\u201d Oliver says. The chutney tradition crossed the pond to the Caribbean and the American South, again with a local twist. In the South, for example, instead of tamarind chutney with vindaloo curry, a cook might serve a peach chutney with ham biscuits. \u201cThe ingredients reflect the region where it\u2019s from. The use reflects the region,\u201d Oliver says. \u201cSouthern ham and pork go well with a sweeter style. Indian chutneys are super-spicy.\u201d Virginia Chutney calls its products Southern-style, and its version of Major Grey\u2019s is well suited for glazing salmon or shrimp. There\u2019s also a kicky green tomato (pronounced to-MAH-to by the Turners) with a slight mustard-seed tang; a spicy plum that works well with cheddar or as a glaze for roast pork; and both sweet and hot peach versions, the latter getting its heat from habanero peppers. In the Turners\u2019 \u201ctest kitchen,\u201d also the family kitchen in their sprawling log cabin home-office, there\u2019s often a chutney on the stove and several more experiments in the fridge. The company\u2019s 120,000 jars a year are handled by a regional contract producer in Pennsylvania, but production is scheduled to shift this fall to a new commercial kitchen the Turners are developing near the office in Rappahannock County. When it comes to matters of chutney, everyone in the family has strong ideas. The elder Turners come by their chutney knowledge naturally. Clare, whose parents served in the British Colonial Service, grew up in Uganda and Kenya until she was 13 and therefore is well versed in the spicier, fresh Indian chutneys as well as the sweeter British ones. Her husband, Nevill, who is from Kent, ate chutney all the time, and his aunt, Kathleen Turner, even wrote it about in a 1932 cooking pamphlet, \u201cBritish Ingredients for British Cooks.\u201d With a degree in biochemistry from Cambridge, Nevill tends to be more scientific in approach than his wife or son. He met Clare in the 1970s in the Caribbean, where they both worked for Colin Tennant, the developer of the jet-setting island of Mustique. Later, they owned a restaurant in St. Lucia, where Oliver\u2019s younger brother, Christopher, was born. (Oliver was born in Barbados.) They came to the States about 30 years ago, choosing Virginia for its schools and business climate. Oliver, who studied English at William and Mary, describes himself as a \u201ccrashing bore\u201d about chutney who has been known to correct the Wikipedia entry. But during my recent visit to their headquarters, which is down the street from the famed Inn at Little Washington, he doesn\u2019t worry so much about sticking to the steps for making green tomato chutney. Chutney is a fairly democratic condiment that, with enough practice, almost anyone can master, he assures me. The ripeness of the fruit, size of the pan and amount of heat used all factor into the final product and allow for variations on taste. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a wine vintage,\u201d Oliver says. \u201cEach one is different.\u201d In separating their chutneys from that of rivals, the Turners emphasize what\u2019s not in them \u2014 no commercial pectin or other coagulants \u2014 as much as what is. Local fruits, such as green tomatoes from the Farm at Sunnyside near them, are used when it\u2019s possible to get a large enough quantity for production. Back in the kitchen, we realize we forgot to add the Granny Smith apples to the bubbling cauldron of green tomatoes, onions, vinegar and spices. So Abigail DeLashmutt, who works in sales and marketing for the company and is Oliver\u2019s girlfriend, chops them up and in they go. Whether you\u2019re casual or scientific in your approach to chutney, the cooking time is critical. \u201cIf you cook it 10 minutes too long, it sets up too hard,\u201d Nevill explains. \u201cTen minutes too short, and it gets runny.\u201d After raisins are added and the chutney nears the finish, I learn how to judge whether it\u2019s runny or ready by taking a wooden spoon and dragging it through the middle of the pot. If you see the bottom of the pot for a second or two, the chutney is done. \u201cThe \u2018parting of the Red Sea\u2019 is a sign you take it off the heat,\u201d Oliver says. The resulting chutney is nuanced and chunky, with sweet and sour tones, and just the right oomph from the mustard seed and crushed red pepper flakes. Soon, another chutney goes into the refrigerator, sure to be discussed by the family. \u201cWe learn every day,\u201d says Clare. \u201cWe never think we nailed it.\u201d Her husband adds: \u201cYou have to be careful what you wish for. We eat, sleep and breathe chutney.\u201d RECIPES: Spicy Apricot Peach Chutney Green Tomato Chutney  See more from lifestyle. food@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-09 10:16:59", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlifestylefoodchutney-born-in-virginia-inspired-by-britain20110802giqarjro4i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 68, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Driven to sing in the karaoke cab", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/driven-to-sing-in-the-karaoke-cab/2011/08/02/gIQA0sSJ3I_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tThe cabbie idles up to the curb outside Whitlow\u2019s in Clarendon, rolls down his window and punches a number into his microphone.

The greater Washington area offers a number of places where you can test this thesis. Chamber opera is thriving all across the country, but our region is a national leader in one niche: summer opera festivals devoted to presenting young professionals. Between the Castleton Festival and the Wolf Trap Opera, we get some of the cream of the crop.  But why do both Castleton and Wolf Trap seek repeatedly to stake out the large-scale standard operatic repertory? Castleton opened its season this year with Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boheme\u201d; on Friday night, the Wolf Trap Opera offered Offenbach\u2019s \u201cTales of Hoffmann\u201d (there are additional performances on Thursday and Saturday).  \u201cHoffmann\u201d sets the bar particularly high. Experienced tenors blanch at the thought of the long, tough role of an ardent and addled poet that has you onstage singing your heart out for a good portion of a long night. (Wolf Trap\u2019s production began at 8 and ended at 11:30, with two intermissions.)  On Friday, Nathaniel Peake hid his blanching and paced himself pretty well; his outing as Pirelli in \u201cSweeney Todd\u201d a couple of weeks ago sounded a lot more forced and effort-full. Still, his Hoffmann didn\u2019t sound easy. His voice has a lot of promise, a clarion firmness that comes out best when it\u2019s not forced, and he has some musical sensitivity. I would have loved to see him in a role that would let him blossom, though he may have learned valuable lessons from pacing himself through this marathon.  What really suffers in this kind of endurance test is the focus on details. The evening\u2019s standout was Catherine Martin as Nicklausse, Hoffmann\u2019s muse, who appears in the guise of a trusted (male) companion for most of the evening. Martin has a gorgeous, warm voice that you want to keep listening to (no small achievement in a role that often seems tiresome), and she\u2019s a big talent. Wolf Trap is a place where she should be learning to avoid the occasional loss of color and focus she showed on individual notes \u2014 but that kind of detail is overlooked when your main focus is getting through a long evening.  \u201cHoffmann\u201d is something of a troubled opera: Unfinished at Offenbach\u2019s death, it\u2019s been subject to any number of tweaks, rearrangements and additions in the 130 years since its premiere, and the very order of its three acts is a subject of debate. The poet Hoffmann, loosely based on German romantic author E.T.A. Hoffmann, is in love with opera singer Stella, and tells his drinking buddies three stories (adapted from Hoffmann\u2019s works) of three past lovers, each encapsulating one aspect of Stella\u2019s character: Olympia, a mechanical doll; Antonia, an opera singer; and Giulietta, a courtesan.  Offenbach wanted all three roles sung by the same woman; the roles are still a showpiece for star sopranos, but Wolf Trap sensibly gave the parts to three singers. Jamie-Rose Guarrine was an imprecise and womanly Olympia; Marcy Stonikas managed to sing a credible Antonia while heavily pregnant (giving real motivation for her father\u2019s hatred of Hoffmann); and Eve Gigliotti was a strong, impassioned Giulietta.  The roles of the villains, however, were all taken by the same singer, the impressive Craig Irvin, who sounded particularly good in \u201cScintille, diamant,\u201d an aria that was interpolated into the opera after Offenbach\u2019s death. Israel Gursky conducted convincingly in a pit so crowded that the harpist had to sit outside it (not uncommon in this tiny theater), and set designer Michael Olich made creative use of rotating wooden boxes to get the opera\u2019s fantastical party scenes and rowdy tavern on the tiny stage.  Dan Rigazzi, the director, also made a virtue of intimacy, in part by having the different characters in Hoffmann\u2019s tales \u201cplayed\u201d by fellow drinkers at the pub, so the whole thing seems partly a sequence of students\u2019 skits. And yet he, too, didn\u2019t attend enough to details \u2014 such as Edward Mout\u2019s relentless overacting in the roles of the three elderly servants. These small things used to make the difference between an ad\u00adequate production and a first-rate one. There was much to like about this \u201cHoffmann,\u201d but these singers, and the Wolf Trap Opera, are capable of doing even better.  midgettea@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-07 16:33:49", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlifestylestyleintimate-long-hoffmann-has-problems-at-wolf-trap-opera20110807giqal4hd1i_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 72, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 3, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Zambello brings personal touch to retooled Glimmerglass Festival", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/zambello-brings-personal-touch-to-retooled-glimmerglass-festival/2011/08/03/gIQAPCbiwI_story.html?wprss=rss_local", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tCOOPERSTOWN, N.Y. Francesca Zambello, the stage director and newly minted impresario, sits at a corner table in the restaurant of the American Hotel in Sharon Springs at the end of the third week of the Glimmerglass Festival that, as of this year, is hers. Tall  with strong features and a thick mane of dark hair and sporting a pair of cowboy boots, Zambello, on the cusp of 55, has the aura of someone who might have just stepped off the stage herself. The cowboy boots, indeed, are a nod to the afternoon\u2019s performance: Zambello\u2019s production of the classic Irving Berlin musical \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun,\u201d with the operatic soprano Deborah Voigt in the title role. As the new general director of Glimmerglass, Zambello is certainly performing. Her role is a mix of stage director and den mother, at once warm and a little bossy, almost aggressively trying to make everyone feel at home. She walks the grounds before shows, visiting patrons\u2019 picnic tables; she personally introduces each performance, making the announcement about turning off your cellphones (and remembering to donate). To get to her table at the restaurant, she moves along a veritable receiving line: patrons from San Francisco and New York; performing arts administrators; the baritone Jake Gardner, fresh from a fine performance as Buffalo Bill; and the owners of the hotel, glowing in the holiday atmosphere of their packed dining room. When Zambello finally takes her seat, a woman approaches from another table; \u201cI just want to tell you how impressed I am,\u201d she says. Zambello immediately stands, thanks her for coming over, and gets her e-mail address.  \u201cAs a director, you can\u2019t sell yourself like this,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate. But when you\u2019re working for an organization and you want to represent the organization \u2014  it\u2019s much easier, because you\u2019re not talking about yourself.\u201d Summer festivals always get attention. Glimmerglass, founded in 1975, has a coterie of patrons who travel every summer to the Alice Busch Opera Theater, a 900-seat house with a distinct summer-cottage vibe on the shore of Otsego Lake, up the road from the Baseball Hall of Fame. This year, there\u2019s a lot of interest in how Zambello, one of opera\u2019s most prominent stage directors, is going to put her stamp on an organization that could use some sprucing up. This is of special interest to Washingtonians, because earlier this year Zambello was named artistic adviser (not artistic director) to the Washington National Opera. Zambello is at a logical point in her career to make a change. As a director, she\u2019s busier than ever: fresh off her acclaimed production of Wagner\u2019s \u201cRing\u201d cycle in San Francisco in June, preparing for a September world premiere of the Sept. 11, 2001, opera \u201cHeart of a Soldier\u201d and, in 2012, \u201cLa Traviata\u201d on a floating stage in Sydney Harbor and the Broadway opening of a musical version of \u201cRebecca.\u201d This mixture of highbrow and mass-market entertainment is a Zambello hallmark: Past highlights range from Prokofiev\u2019s \u201cWar and Peace\u201d to Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d on Broadway. The variety is also an indication that she\u2019s looking for more now than the routine of simply moving from opera house to opera house, staging one opera after another.  \u201cI\u2019ve done that,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m eager to take my experience and see how I can put it to use with an organization.\u201d Plus, she adds, \u201cI want to be in the States more. I\u2019ve worked abroad a lot.\u201d  Zambello isn\u2019t new to administration; in the 1980s, she ran Milwaukee\u2019s Skylight Opera for seven seasons. More recently, she was a candidate when the New York City Opera was hastily searching for leadership after the provocative Belgian Gerard Mortier withdrew before ever taking over. The job ultimately went to George Steel, who ran the small and eclectic Miller Theater at Columbia University before a brief stint as head of the Dallas Opera; Zambello, with some of the proverbial fury of the woman scorned, ended up at Glimmerglass, a company that long was seen as a kind of City Opera affiliate.  After two years of Steel\u2019s tenure, though, it\u2019s City Opera that\u2019s struggling to survive. \u201cIt\u2019s the last job in the world I\u2019d want right now,\u201d Zambello says.  Glimmerglass, by contrast, is doing pretty well. Under Zambello\u2019s predecessor Michael MacLeod, the festival had cut back to three productions; it\u2019s returned to four, now, on a $6.4 million budget, and Zambello says that ticket sales are up by 20 percent. (This year\u2019s offerings, in addition to \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun,\u201d are Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen,\u201d Cherubini\u2019s \u201cMedea\u201d and a double bill of contemporary operas, \u201cLater the Same Evening\u201d by John Musto and \u201cA Blizzard on Marblehead Neck\u201d by Jeanine Tesori.) Zambello, though working hard to put a new face on the festival, is avoiding the new-broom approach that MacLeod took when he came in and recast Glimmerglass\u2019s season\u2019s thematically, offering four operas about Orpheus. Even Zambello\u2019s Broadway initiative isn\u2019t new; it was MacLeod who brought in Glimmerglass\u2019s first musical, \u201cKiss Me Kate,\u201d for his Shakespeare season in 2008.  Zambello\u2019s innovations are lower-key \u2014  adding cabaret-style performances in the theater\u2019s open-air pavilion; creating the position of resident artist for a big-name singer (this year, Voigt) every summer. She\u2019s rewritten the mission statement to emphasize education; one-quarter of Glimmerglass\u2019s budget goes to its 30 young artists (who perform small roles and do double duty as the opera chorus) and 50 production and administrative interns. She\u2019s reaching out to the community: holding a free concert for the wives of inductees to the Baseball Hall of Fame; getting local kids on stage in the children\u2019s chorus in \u201cCarmen.\u201d The last endeavor is close to her heart: This summer in San Francisco, she choked up when talking about how some of the kids she cast as Nibelungs in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDas Rheingold\u201d in Washington had caught the opera bug and stayed involved in music.  Zambello also has great connections. \u201cA lot of it is asking your friends,\u201d she said. This summer, she\u2019s lured singer friends into accepting Glimmerglass\u2019s relatively modest fees, sometimes by hiring entire families. The baritone David Pittsinger and his wife Patricia Schuman play the poet Eugene O\u2019Neill and his wife in Tesori\u2019s new opera, \u201cA Blizzard on Marblehead Neck,\u201d and two of their children are in \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun.\u201d Rod Gilfry\u2019s daughter Carin is in the young artist program, and singing with her father in a recital. (Zambello\u2019s own family has come to Glimmerglass as well, including her mother, the actress Jean Sincere, a nonagenarian who has made a few appearances as the librarian on \u201cGlee.\u201d) The bottom line, however, is the work, and Glimmerglass this summer is a mixed but generally engaging bag. It\u2019s a good sign that the most familiar opera, \u201cCarmen,\u201d gets such a fresh and involving production from the experimental theater director Anne Bogart. Unlike many straight theater directors in opera, Bogart held the singers to the same standards as actors, working to create choreographed movement that was both realistic and stylized, a visual reflection of opera\u2019s musical conventions, while trusting the story enough to tell it directly and honestly. The opera was only adequately sung \u2014  Anya Matanovic\u2019s exquisitely realized Micaela was the standout, while Ginger Costa-Jackson smoldered but made an artificially darkened sound in the title role \u2014 but it did show an advantage of adding Broadway to the Glimmerglass mix: The young artist program included several Broadway singers who could also dance, which gave a relaxed, delightfully naturalistic vibe to dance scenes that usually entail bringing in the ballet.  The double bill, which included a world premiere, juxtaposed two composers who have a musical theater sensibility. Musto has written three operas in the past seven years for Washington: \u201cLater the Same Evening,\u201d based on five paintings by Edward Hopper, came to Glimmerglass in a version of Leon Major\u2019s 2007 production from the University of Maryland. Reencountering this agile, light-fingered score made me feel again that Musto has a truly great opera or musical in him, but this isn\u2019t it. Though the music does everything it can to breathe life into the action, Mark Campbell\u2019s libretto diminishes Hopper\u2019s figures by putting words in their mouths, and there is no attempt, a la Sondheim\u2019s \u201cSunday in the Park with George,\u201d to address what was actually artistic about Hopper\u2019s art. The opera instead offers a paean to theater, culminating in a clever play-within-a-play that has nothing to do with Hopper and is effective precisely because it\u2019s communicated in music and gesture, with no words at all. Tesori has written successful Broadway shows (\u201cThoroughly Modern Millie;\u201d \u201cCaroline, or Change\u201d), and she and Tony Kushner, who wrote \u201cBlizzard on Marblehead Neck\u201d (Zambello\u2019s first Glimmerglass commission) are working on a piece for the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s commissioning program. Tesori\u2019s music doesn\u2019t have Musto\u2019s finesse; it gets the job done bluntly, in big gestures that are what many people expect from opera, backed up by her own earnest conducting. Pair that with a libretto that turned an opera about a marital spat into an effective short story, and an outstanding performance from Pittsinger as O\u2019Neill, and the audience will, and did, respond. The double bill has sold well above the company\u2019s expectations.  \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun\u201d was the most hyped of this year\u2019s productions, representing the \u201cnew\u201d Glimmerglass and featuring Voigt in a departure from her wonted Wagnerian roles. Unfortunately, it misfired. Voigt and Gilfry, two good-looking opera stars, happen to be strikingly uncharismatic performers. Instead of showing glorious voices and personality in delightful music, they looked and sounded like fish out of water, aware at every moment that Broadway was not their natural medium. Their sung phrases flopped spasmodically from inaudibility to full-bore fortes due to poor control of their vocal registers, and they acted as if everything they did were in quotation marks, offering wink-wink nudge-nudge performances like something out of summer stock. (Let\u2019s not even get into the \u201cHows\u201d and broken English of the musical\u2019s \u201cInjun\u201d characters \u2014 Zambello prided herself on presenting the original 1946 text, but authenticity can be overrated.) The rest of the production was better \u2014 and the four kids, including the two junior Pittsingers, were terrific \u2014  but it felt as if Zambello, who also directed Tesori\u2019s opera, didn\u2019t have the time to elicit from these singers the kind of compelling performance she is known for.  At the dinner table after the performance, Zambello outlines some of her hopes for Washington. There\u2019s her \u201cRing\u201d cycle, which began in Washington, was called off in 2009, after the first three operas, for lack of funds, and will almost certainly be back in a coming season. There are ideas for testing out young talent in the Terrace and Eisenhower Theaters, or bringing in other companies for collaborations of the kind she\u2019s planning next year for Glimmerglass (when Lully\u2019s \u201cArmide\u201d will be co-produced with Canada\u2019s Opera Atelier, and Kurt Weill\u2019s \u201cLost in the Stars,\u201d with the Cape Town Opera). There\u2019s defining the mission of a company that has seemed rudderless of late \u2014  perhaps freeing WNO from the implications of the \u201cNational\u201d in its name, which has become something of a millstone around its neck. \u201cWe can\u2019t do an American opera every year,\u201d Zambello says, \u201cnor should we.\u201d  Perhaps most to the point, though, is simply improving the quality of WNO\u2019s productions; actively reaching out to Washington\u2019s international audiences; \u201cjust creating,\u201d she says, \u201cmore buzz around the company.\u201d  \u201cMichael [Kaiser] has been great,\u201d says Zambello. \u201cIt\u2019s not, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about the budget,\u2019 but, \u2018Come up with some ideas that we can fundraise around.\u2019 You need ideas to fundraise around,\u201d she adds, speaking with the benefit of her fresh, Glimmerglass experience. \u201cYou can\u2019t excite people about something if you don\u2019t have something to excite them about.\u201d  midgettea@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-05 11:09:07", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlifestylestylezambello-brings-personal-touch-to-retooled-glimmerglass-festival20110803giqapcbiwi_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 80, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 09:56:11", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Teaching strategies that work!\u00a0 But for what?", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/teaching-strategies-that-work-but-for-what/2011/08/10/gIQAw3Yt6I_blog.html?wprss=answer-sheet", "content": "<p>This <i>was written by <a href=\"http://www.alfiekohn.org/index.php\">Alfie Kohn</a>, the author of 12 books about education and human behavior, including \u201cThe Schools Our Children Deserve,\u201d \u201cThe Homework Myth,\u201d and the newly published\u201c<a href=\"http://www.alfiekohn.org/books/fbe.htm\">Feel-Bad Education . . .

My father might be in Riyadh today, Jerusalem the next day.\u201d Her father, of course, was one of the acolytes of storied TV journalist Edward R. Murrow at CBS. He also hosted NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in the 1980s and made Richard M. Nixon\u2019s \u201cenemies list.\u201d And with such a role model and such progeny, it must have seemed natural for father and daughter to collaborate on a book that would take five years to research, diving into presidential diaries and libraries and interviewing hundreds of officials. The result is \u201cHaunting Legacy: Vietnam and the American Presidency From Ford to Obama.\u201d The book offers a detailed history of presidential decisions that are influenced both emotionally and strategically by the sobering lessons of the Vietnam War. The Kalbs write: \u201cThe United States has never lost a war \u2014 that is, until 1975 when it was forced to flee Saigon in humiliation after losing to what Lyndon Johnson called \u2018a raggedy-ass little fourth-rate country.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The ghosts of Vietnam resonate deeply today with a generation that has lived amid the conflicts of the Iraq war and the expanding battleground in Afghanistan. The book raises questions and offers insights into how Vietnam might determine the way and the reasons presidents send people to war \u2014 in other words, the power of the past on the present. \u201cAll major books about Vietnam have been about the war; what is different about this book is that it\u2019s about the legacy of that war,\u201d said Marvin Kalb, who looks 10 years younger than his 81 years and has a lush head of white hair. \u201cObama fancied himself a post-Vietnam, post-Cold War president, yet he was haunted by Vietnam. It\u2019s all just a fascinating topic that impacts Washington today.\u201d Hardworking duo Writing a book seems hard enough, though it\u2019s something the elder Kalb has done eight times. But what was it like for Marvin Kalb to write a hefty intellectual tome with his daughter? For that matter, what was it like for the daughter? Were there arguments? \u201cNot many at all,\u201d Deborah Kalb said on a recent morning when the writing duo sat in the cafeteria of the Brookings Institution, whose press published \u201cHaunting Legacy\u201d in May. \u201cIt was a great learning experience to work with my father. I feel really fortunate to be in my 40s and yet have an older generation, especially my father, to learn from. Plus, we broke down the chapters. He focused on the foreign policy side. I did the politics and Vietnam.\u201d The result is \u201ca very timely book of reportage, and it deals with one of the questions that may go unanswered forever. People are still debating if we are still haunted by World War I,\u201d said Stanley Karnow, 86, author of \u201cVietnam: A History,\u201d who covered the war for The Washington Post and lives in Potomac. \u201cBut they hit a timely issue with people wandering around the Pentagon right now wondering if Afghanistan is another Vietnam.\u201d \u201cHaunting Legacy,\u201d for instance, attempts to reach inside the mind of President Obama and his worries that Afghanistan would become his Vietnam. In a riveting account, it paints a picture of Obama\u2019s July 2008 trip on a U.S. military plane headed from Andrews Air Force Base toward Kuwait City and to Afghanistan. On the plane, Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) describes a sort of \u201cseminar,\u201d where Obama, then a presidential candidate, asks Reed and a carefully selected \u201ctroika of consequential senators\u201d to talk to him about the lessons of Vietnam. \u201cNot so much the history, which he thought he knew, but the powerful legacy of the war, which he sensed at every turn in his rising career,\u201d the pair write. In interviews, Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska and co-chair of Obama\u2019s National Intelligence Board, paraphrases Obama for the Kalbs as saying: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be held hostage to what happened in Vietnam. This is a new ballgame, a new day, a new world.\u201d Destined for the effort While there are other father-daughter and husband-wife writing teams, the Kalbs seemed destined for such an effort. In their home, writing, and talking geopolitics and history, was as normal a family activity as birthday parties or movie night. Marvin\u2019s wife, Madeleine, wrote the definitive book on the struggle for Congo, \u201cThe Congo Cables: The Cold War in Africa \u2014 From Eisenhower to Kennedy.\u201d Madeleine Kalb helped husband and daughter shape their book\u2019s central theme. She\u2019s \u201ca very good editor,\u201d Marvin Kalb said, with \u201ca very uncluttered mind.\u201d But the Kalb-family writing careers don\u2019t stop there. Marvin Kalb\u2019s other daughter, Judith Kalb, an associate professor and Russian program director at the University of South Carolina, is author of \u201cRussia\u2019s Rome: Imperial Visions, Messianic Dreams, 1890-1940,\u201d an examination of Russia\u2019s identification with Rome during the revolutions in 1905 and 1917. His brother Bernard Kalb was a foreign correspondent at CBS News, NBC News and the New York Times and was based in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Paris and Vietnam. The brothers co-wrote books, including a biography titled \u201cKissinger\u201d and \u201cThe Last Ambassador,\u201d a novel about the collapse of Saigon in 1975. The family sounds serious but has a playful side. \u201cAs a family growing up, we loved to get together at Chinese restaurants,\u201d Deborah Kalb said, laughing. \u201cWe were not always discussing geopolitics.\u201d Karnow has been a friend of the family for years and said \u201cHaunting Legacy\u201d was a good use of collective family interests. \u201cI\u2019ve known Deborah since she was born,\u201d Karnow said. \u201cThey are a real journalist family. You put the family together and they sometimes resemble a Woody Allen movie, with everyone talking over each other.\u201d A writer in the making At a recent reading from the Kalbs\u2019 book at Politics & Prose, some attendees had served in Vietnam, while others had studied the war; others seemed to be interested in the father-daughter dynamic. Deborah brought her son, Aaron, who\u2019s almost 6. Not surprisingly, he recently wrote a short book about Pluto for his kindergarten class. At the bookstore, he \u201csat there reading a collection of stories about pirates and other adventures the whole time,\u201d Deborah Kalb said. So maybe Aaron\u2019s next book could be a collaboration with his mother and grandfather? \u201cWell, that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said Marvin Kalb with a laugh. waxe@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-05 14:54:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlifestylestylea-passion-for-writing-and-geopolitics-for-the-kalbs-it-runs-in-the-family20110802giqamv05wi_storyhtmlwprssrss_local"}}, {"pk": 75, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Congress less popular than, well, so many things", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/whats-congress-less-popular-than-among-other-things-human-cloning/2011/08/09/gIQAznM26I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tCloning sheep. Cloning humans, even. Caning teen vandals. Believing that aliens have descended from space and abducted humans. These are all things that, at one time or another, have enjoyed more public backing than Congress is getting right now. Even President George W. Bush, at his lowest of lows during the 2008 financial crisis, was more popular than the men and women who currently occupy Capitol Hill. Ragging on Congress, with its sluglike reaction times and inspiring displays of public bickering, has long been a favorite national pastime. But recent polls indicate that Congress\u2019s approval ratings have sunk to all-time lows. Which is pretty bad for an outfit that\u2019s been around since 1787. A recent CNN poll found that just 14 percent of Americans surveyed approved of how Congress has been doing its job. And a new Washington Post poll found that only 17\u00a0percent of Americans surveyed thought their representative should be reelected in 2012. \u201cThese are notably low,\u201d said Charles Stewart III, a political scientist at MIT. Stewart said Congress might possibly have been even less popular during the days leading up to the Civil War, or during the less-remembered political upheavals of the 1880s and \u201990s. But it has never been rated lower since the advent of widespread public polling on Congress, which Stewart dated to the 1970s, than it has been in recent days. \u201cIt\u2019s undoubtedly reflecting a generalized disgust with the institution,\u201d he said. For a little comparison, a 1997 ABC poll found that 39 percent approved of cloning sheep. Pollsters for Johns Hopkins University found in 2002 that 18 percent approved of human cloning. A survey from Gallup in June showed that Americans have more confidence in banks and even HMOs than in Congress. And Americans, as polled by CNN in 1997, were 3\u20091/2 times as likely to believe in alien kidnappings than they now are to approve of Congress. And 37 percent of respondents told the Los Angeles Times in 1994 that they thought it was a good idea to cane teen vandals, after an 18-year-old was famously sentenced to a beating in Singapore. There was no available information on what percentage of Americans think it\u2019s a good idea to cane members of Congress \u2014 or to abduct them. The causes of the revulsion are both obvious and bedeviling: a constitutional system set up to promote divided and gridlocked government. General anxiety about a lagging world economy that makes Congress\u2019s clashes appear even more reckless. A media environment that caters to partisans and spotlights conflict. And, maybe most important, a political class that reflects real and deep divisions among the people it represents about the proper size and scope of government. \u201cIf the Constitution was designed to create gridlock, and we\u2019ve discovered the Congress and the president are in gridlock now, who should we really blame here?\u201d Stewart asked. But that doesn\u2019t mean Congress couldn\u2019t give image improvement a try. Second chances are quintessentially American, and there are tons of examples of hated companies and personalities who have successfully turned things around that Congress could look to for inspiration. Toyota appears to be successfully rebounding from a series of reputation-damaging recalls. Michael Vick is back on top after serving time in prison for his involvement with a dog-fighting ring. Few people even remember that Tylenol\u2019s image once took a hit after seven people died in 1983 from ingesting pills that had been poisoned, without the company\u2019s knowledge, with cyanide. Public relations managers say the keys to a turnaround are easy to explain, though not necessarily easy to replicate: Be humble. Apologize. Most important, examine why your reputation has tanked and make real changes to address it. These are not traits most people readily associate with politicians. \u201cIt can\u2019t be window dressing,\u201d said Jesse Derris, a crisis consultant for the public relations firm Sunshine Sachs. \u201cWhen you have a truly successful rehabilitation effort, there\u2019s substance behind it.\u201d Derris would not discuss his clients, but he has been publicly identified as a spokesman for the chief executive of Merrill Lynch during the 2008 market crash; the New York Jets; and Disney star Demi Lovato. He said that from athletes to movie stars, there\u2019s always one tried-and-true route to image improvement: Do your job well, and then keep at it. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a one-off,\u201d Derris said. \u201cWhatever happens has to be sustained.\u201d Part of Congress\u2019s problem is that some of the tried-and-true tactics employed by companies and personalities are inaccessible. Congress can\u2019t re-brand itself by changing its name or mission statement, which has been pretty well established for the past couple of hundred years. Congress\u2019s stakeholders could oust its management or employees. But the public has tried that route repeatedly, including last year, and doesn\u2019t appear satisfied with the results. Nick Ragone, director of the Washington office of communications firm Ketchum, said he will sometimes advise corporate clients seeking to improve their image to go hyper-transparent, to overcommunicate about their strategy. But, he said, Congress\u2019s problem is that Americans have been watching lawmakers do their job for the past several weeks more closely than usual. And they don\u2019t like what they\u2019ve seen. Hyper-transparency, it would seem, only hurts Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird paradox,\u201d he said. \u201cThe counsel we\u2019d give clients is not available here.\u201d There is one thing that could work: time. James A. Stimson, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina, has found that approval of both the president and Congress has always risen and fallen with the economy. Stimson said this Congress has hurt its cause through months of public gridlock. But he said that when the economy rebounds, public approval probably will, too. \u201cCongress will never be popular,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be less unpopular.\u201d heldermanr@washpost.com craighillp@washpost.com Staff writer David A.

The regulations require fuel-efficiency improvements of as much as 23 percent by model year 2018, compared with the industry\u2019s 2010 baseline. The administration estimates that the rules will save a total of $50\u00a0billion in fuel costs and 530\u00a0million barrels of oil during that period.  Heavy-duty trucks and buses account for 20\u00a0percent of the nation\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions. Federal officials said the stricter limits will increase the cost of a tractor-trailer by $6,220 while saving $73,000 in fuel costs over the operating life. The regulations were welcomed by trucking industry officials, a response unlike that received by recently announced fuel-efficiency standards for passenger cars and light trucks, which prompted a contentious behind-the-scenes battle in Washington.  \u201cWhile we were working to improve the efficiency of cars and light-duty trucks, something interesting happened,\u201d President Obama said in a statement. \u201cWe started getting letters asking that we do the same for medium and heavy-duty trucks. They were from the people who build, buy, and drive these trucks. And today, I\u2019m proud to have the support of these companies as we announce the first-ever national policy to increase fuel efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas pollution from medium-and heavy-duty trucks.\u201d  With this regulation, all classes of U.S. vehicles now must meet some fuel efficiency standard. Before making the announcement, Obama met for a half-hour in the Roosevelt Room with more than a half-dozen industry representatives, including Bill Graves, president and chief executive of the American Trucking Associations, and Jed Mandel, president of the Engine Manufacturers Association.  \u201cEveryone was sort of patting everyone else on the back,\u201d Graves said in a phone interview, adding that his members are confident that they will be able to buy vehicles that meet the new requirements. \u201cEverybody knows what the expectations are, and everyone has lead time to meet those expectations. .\u2009.\u2009. I honestly believe one of the reasons we the users have confidence in this rule is we know how competitive these truck manufacturers, engine manufacturers are.\u201d Industry officials predicted that they will meet the new standards without a problem. Douglas W. Stotlar, president and chief executive of the freight transportation company Con-way Inc., called it \u201ca realistic solution that will ultimately help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve natural resources by helping to increase the fuel efficiency of our industry.\u201d  Tim Solso, chairman and chief executive of Cummins Inc., the world\u2019s largest independent manufacturer of diesel engines, said, \u201cHaving a clear set of standards allows us to invest in technologies that we will use not only here in the United States but globally.\u201d Environmentalists also hailed the new rules \u2014 issued jointly by the Transportation Department and the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 as a step forward in reducing the nation\u2019s carbon output. Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in an e-mail that the U.S. fleet of trucks and buses \u201cconsumes nearly 2.5\u00a0million barrels of oil per day\u201d and that the regulation would \u201ccut climate pollution by 270 million metric tons.\u201d \u201cU.S. engine makers in the heartland of our nation have world class products that will help break our addiction to foreign oil, save Americans hard earned money through more fuel efficient engines, cut dangerous pollution, and expand clean technology exports,\u201d Patton wrote.  Under the new limits, fuel efficiency for one type of tractor-trailer \u2014  a big rig with a  \u201chigh roof sleeper cab\u201d \u2014 would improve about 23 percent by 2018, and average miles per gallon would rise from 6 to 7.2.  Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, said in an interview that the rules were significant because \u201cit\u2019s the first time globally a country has set efficiency standards for the full heavy-duty vehicle.\u201d Japan set standards for heavy-duty truck engines in 2006 but did not address parts that included the vehicles\u2019 transmission and tires. Setting the next round of standards, which would probably cover the trailing equipment pulled behind the trucks, could prove more difficult. Graves said that truckers expect fuel savings from the new rules will make up for the higher cost of equipment within two to three years but that it will be harder when trailers are \u201cadded to the mix.\u201d eilperinj@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-09 11:23:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomnationalhealth-scienceadministration-sets-fuel-efficiency-rules-for-heavy-duty-trucks-and-buses20110809giqan4zv4i_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 82, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 09:56:11", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "On Faith: \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDoes prayer get in the way of progress?", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-faith/post/does-prayer-get-in-the-way-of-progress/2011/08/08/gIQA8W152I_blog.html?wprss=on-faith", "content": "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/sandp-considering-first-downgrade-of-us-credit-rating/2011/08/05/gIQAqKeIxI_story.html\">S&amp;P downgraded America\u2019s credit rating</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia/dozens-of-us-troops-feared-killed-as-nato-helicopter-crashes-in-afghan-offensive/2011/08/06/gIQAlbT2xI_story.html\">country remains engaged in two wars</a>, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/44/post/west-wing-briefing-unemployed-largely-off-washingtons-radar/2011/03/31/AFGgGL9B_blog.html\">millions are unemployed</a> and<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/congress-approval-rating-just-sank-to-a-record-breaking-low-2011-8\"> approval ratings for Congress are at historic lows. </a>  It was against this backdrop that<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/under-god/post/rick-perrys-prayer-at-the-response-father-our-heart-breaks-for-america-video/2011/08/06/gIQAPTFuyI_blog.html\"> Texas Governor Rick Perry held The Response</a>, a prayer event in which he prayed for the economy, among other areas of \u201cdarkness\u201d in America.

O\u2019Neill, Harvard Business School professor and author Bill George, leadership expert Katherine Tyler Scott,Wharton School professor Michael Useem, and Woodrow Wilson Center scholar Amy M. Wilkinson. In our society, there are some things that can only be done by presidential leadership. Fundamentally fixing the country\u2019s unemployment  problem and strengthening, more broadly, its economic engine is one of them. It can\u2019t happen merely at the hands of business leaders. The major impediments to higher rates of growth are structural. And it\u2019s ultimately only our government leaders\u2014particularly the  president\u2014who can help us overcome them, by taking the initiative to overhaul  several of these massive, systemic flaws. To start, we have an unbelievably inefficient tax system in America. It  costs our society hundreds of billions of dollars to administer each year, not  to mention it under-collects the revenue owed by hundreds of billions of dollars  more. And this is further complicated by the fact that the tax system, which  should be about raising the revenue we need to pay for the agreed shared needs of U.S. society, is really more about social engineering\u2014every credit and every  deduction is formulated to create incentives and disincentives for Americans to cultivate particular behaviors. That shouldn\u2019t be its mandate. Our lives and the prospects of our economy would be  vastly improved if we could reset the tax system to raise revenue; we could do  so with some sort of value-added tax. Then, whatever social engineering our  government leaders choose to do can be done by writing checks to the people we want to favor. A collateral benefit would be that no individual, non-profit or  company would ever have to give money to members of Congress again in hopes of  receiving or maintaining a tax benefit. There are two other structural changes we need to make in order to improve our growth potential. One is to convert our \u2018Ponzi scheme\u2019 entitlement  programs into truly funded programs to ensure financial security for the aged  and disabled, and the other is to focus on the trillion-dollar opportunity\u2014per year\u2014we have to eliminate waste and error in our health and medical care systems. To fix these  three major impediments to U.S. growth requires presidential leadership, and it begins with a truth-telling diagnosis of the problems and the opportunities. We will return to a better growth path in time, but it will never be what it could be until we fix these structural problems. Paul H.

Sgt. John Russell, 46, is accused of carrying out the deadliest act of soldier-on-soldier violence in the war in Iraq as he was nearing the end of his third tour in 2009. He\u2019s been charged with five counts of premeditated murder, two counts of attempted premeditated murder and one count of assault. The government wants to pursue his prosecution as a capital case. The Army concluded a four-day hearing Thursday on whether Russell should face a court martial. The presiding officer will recommend whether a trial should go forward or whether the charges should be modified or dismissed. Russell\u2019s attorneys have used testimony to suggest that he was under stress from multiple deployments in Iraq and frustrated with what they have described as inadequate mental health treatment. One of them, Capt. Larris Hutton, said during closing arguments that Russell\u2019s mind \u201cwas cracking, and it cracked and cracked again.\u201d  \u201cSergeant Russell didn\u2019t calculate. Sergeant Russell didn\u2019t evaluate. Sergeant Russell didn\u2019t premeditate,\u201d Hutton said. Government attorneys sought to show that whatever stress he faced, Russell remained coherent enough just before the shootings in May 2009 to reflect on his actions.  \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Sergeant Russell murdered five people,\u201d said one of the prosecuting attorneys, Capt. Patrick Scudieri. \u201cHe went down to the combat stress clinic, where he knew everyone in that clinic was unarmed.\u201d Killed in the shooting were Navy Cmdr. Charles Springle, 52, of Wilmington, N.C., and four Army service members: Pfc. Michael Edward Yates Jr., 19, of Federalsburg, Md.; Dr. Matthew Houseal, of Amarillo, Texas; Sgt. Christian E. Bueno-Galdos, 25, of Paterson, N.J.; and Spc. Jacob D. Barton, 20, of Lenox, Mo. Russell\u2019s case has raised questions about the mental problems for soldiers caused by repeated tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan and whether the Army\u2019s mental health care is adequate. The case led to an investigation and a critical report. An August 2009 memo, admitted as evidence near the end of the hearing, showed that a three-member evaluation panel from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington found that Russell suffered from severe depression \u201cWith Psychotic Features\u201d and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. It also said Russell was \u201cunable to cooperate intelligently\u201d in his own evaluation. A later evaluation, dated March 2011, said Russell was suffering from those conditions at the time of the shooting. The report said his major depression with psychotic features was \u201cIn Partial Remission.\u201d And a statement, signed by attorneys for both sides and admitted as evidence, said Russell underwent treatment at a federal prison medical center in Butner, N.C., starting in August 2009 and the warden didn\u2019t consider him \u201crestored to competency\u201d until July 2010. In an interview after the hearing ended, two of Russell\u2019s sisters, Suzanne Laugner, of Dennison, Texas, and Jennifer Young, of Colbert, Okla., said he\u2019d had mental health issues after his second tour of duty in Iraq in 2005 and 2006. Russell grew up near Sherman, Texas, about 60 miles north of Dallas. When Russell\u2019s sisters visited him in the North Carolina medical center in October 2009, they found, according to Young, \u201cHe was gone.\u201d  \u201cHe didn\u2019t look at us,\u201d Young said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a blank stare. He couldn\u2019t make a complete sentence or thought.\u201d During the hearing, witnesses offered some conflicting testimony about Russell\u2019s interactions with the combat stress clinic in the days before the shootings. His attorneys presented testimony suggesting that two officers there treated him poorly, dismissing his mental health concerns. James Culp, another one of Russell\u2019s attorneys, called the government\u2019s pursuit of the death penalty \u201cunforgiveable\u201d in an interview. Laugner said the Army needs to acknowledge mistakes by its personnel in her brother\u2019s care and learn from them.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t learn from them, you\u2019re going to make those mistakes over and over,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen over and over.\u201d Members of victims\u2019 families also attended the hearing but did not respond to a request for interviews made through Army officials. But Scudieri said defense attorneys are trying to pin blame on the people Russell encountered at Camp Liberty, outside Baghdad. Scudieri said Russell dealt with experienced mental health professionals and noted that Russell went back to the clinic for help within several days.  \u201cThe only person to blame for these five, cold-blooded murders is seated three seats behind me,\u201d Scudieri said, referring to Russell. Hutton said defense attorneys are not dismissing the seriousness of Russell\u2019s actions, nor the scope of the tragedy or the loss to the other service members\u2019 families. But, Hutton said, Russell was \u201cwounded,\u201d needed immediate help and did not get the assistance he needed. Witnesses on Thursday included Capt. David Vasquez, the second in command of Russell\u2019s unit, the 54th Engineer Battalion, based in Bamberg, Germany. He said Russell was upset the day before the shootings and again on the morning of the shootings, when he looked as though he had not slept.  \u201cHe was just rambling on about how we all had just given up on him and didn\u2019t like him at all,\u201d Vasquez said, testifying by phone from Afghanistan. But during cross-examination by Scudieri, Vasquez acknowledged that Russell was coherent.  \u201cI could understand him,\u201d he said. Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Lee Grace Dougherty, 29, Dylan Dougherty Stanley, 26, and Ryan Edward Dougherty, 21, are being held in Pueblo County, Colo., on bonds of $1.25 million each. The three made their first court appearance Thursday by video from jail, and none made any statement during the brief hearing. They face charges of attempted murder of a peace officer and assault on a peace officer. The charges stem from allegations that they shot rounds from an AK-47 at four patrol cars during a chase Wednesday on Interstate 25 in Colorado. The chase ended when troopers deployed spike strips to puncture the tires of the trio\u2019s Subaru, and the vehicle rolled and crashed into a guardrail. According to an arrest affidavit, Lee Dougherty ran from the crash and was shot in the leg by Walsenburg Police Chief James Chamblerlain after she pointed a \u201cmachine pistol\u201d at him. The document says she later told police, \u201cI deserved to get shot.\u201d Investigators said that when they asked her about gunfire during the chase, Lee Dougherty said she thought authorities were firing at them. Authorities said they didn\u2019t fire at the fugitives\u2019 car and believe she might have mistaken the sound of the spike strips for gunshots.  \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to hurt anyone; we just wanted them to get back. They were way back and we could barely see them,\u201d she said, according to the affidavit. Separate affidavits for the three don\u2019t include statements from the brothers. The trio\u2019s mother, Barbara Bell of East Palatka, Fla., spoke briefly Thursday to The Associated Press but declined to discuss their ordeal, saying she didn\u2019t think it would help them in the long run.  \u201cThank God they\u2019re not tried by the media,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re tried in a court of law and their story will come out at that time.\u201d Bell hung up the phone shortly after a reporter called, saying she needed to keep the line open for concerned family members to reach her.  \u201cI\u2019m devastated and I\u2019m trying to be strong for other family members,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThroughout all of this, I think everybody just wanted it to stop. And now it\u2019s over.\u201d The public defender appointed to represent the siblings, William Martinez, didn\u2019t immediately return a phone message. The siblings also have no-bond warrants in Georgia and Florida on charges they robbed a bank in Georgia and shot at a police officer in Florida on Aug. 2.  \u201cThese three have a big legal mess in front of them, and at some point they\u2019ll face charges in all those jurisdictions,\u201d FBI Special Agent Phil Niedringhaus said. Dylan Stanley and Ryan Dougherty are from Lacoochee, Fla. Lee Dougherty had been living with a boyfriend in Orlando, Fla., according to the Pasco County Sheriff\u2019s office. Although another court hearing has been scheduled for the siblings in Pueblo on Monday, it\u2019s not clear whether they will ultimately be tried in court in Colorado, another state or federal court.  \u201cState and federal agents and prosecutors continue to coordinate to determine what the appropriate next step is,\u201d said Jeff Dorschner, a spokesman for Colorado\u2019s U.S. attorney, John Walsh. Pueblo County District Attorney Bill Thiebaut won\u2019t file charges until he can review reports from five state and local agencies involved in the Colorado chase. He said he hasn\u2019t been in contact with prosecutors from other states.  \u201cMy inclination is that if we can ethically charge these people with a serious crime here out of our office in Pueblo, it\u2019s likely we will be doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have probable cause, we will do that.\u201d Attempted murder, the more serious of the preliminary Colorado charges, carries a sentence of up to 12 years in prison, but that could be increased to 48 years if it\u2019s found to be a crime of violence under Colorado law, he said. The hunt for the siblings moved to Colorado on Tuesday after a sighting in Colorado Springs, where they reportedly bought camping gear. After images of the trio were broadcast on television, someone tipped Colorado state troopers and the Pueblo County sheriff Wednesday that the suspects might be at a campground in the remote San Isabel National Forest in southern Colorado. A Pueblo County sheriff\u2019s detective spotted the car near an interstate highway that day and followed it discreetly until state troopers joined him. Then the chase was on. Jenny Neal, a clerk who was working when the siblings went to the Sinclair gas station in Colorado City, said she had not been paying attention to the news so she didn\u2019t know who they were. After a detective came to the store to review video footage, Neal learned it was Dylan Stanley who went into the store by himself and bought vitamin water, sunflower seeds and gas.  \u201cHe was perfectly polite and friendly and, you know, completely calm and courteous, and I really didn\u2019t think anything about it,\u201d said Neal, 38.  \u201cIt\u2019s probably better that I didn\u2019t know anything, you know. I mean, it could\u2019ve been different had I recognized them and been nervous or anything. It\u2019s a scary thought,\u201d she said. ___ Associated Press writers Russ Bynum in Georgia; Mitch Stacy, Harry Weber and Michael Schneider in Florida; and Dan Elliott and Ivan Moreno in Colorado contributed to this report. ___ Follow Kristen Wyatt at http://twitter.com/APkristenwyatt .

AMR Corp. described terms of the spin-off to AMR shareholders in a regulatory filing Thursday. It expects to complete the deal by year-end. AMR tried to sell or spin off Eagle in 2007 but dropped those plans a year later when record-high fuel prices and the recession cut the value of regional airlines. It revived the plans last year. Company officials declined to say Thursday whether they received any offers to buy Eagle. Eagle operates shorter flights and connects passengers from secondary airports to American Airlines flights at hub airports. AMR thinks it can save money by putting that service up for bidding between Eagle and other regional airlines. Eagle would operate regional flights for American for nine years after the spin-off, according to an AMR filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Eagle had revenue last year of $1.2 billion, a tiny part of AMR\u2019s total of $22.2 billion. It operates 281 planes and 1,650 daily flights. AMR says Eagle would transfer jets to American and lease them back. AMR would keep nearly $2 billion in related debt. Eagle would start with no long-term debt, AMR officials said. While American uses an in-house company for regional flying, most other large U.S. airlines contract with independent operators such as Pinnacle Airlines Corp. and SkyWest Inc. Dan Garton, the longtime AMR executive now leading Eagle, said consumers won\u2019t notice a difference from the Eagle spinoff. He said American will still pick routes and set fares and service.  \u201cThe vast majority of the regional airline business already operates in this manner,\u201d Garton said. \u201cWhen you walk on an airplane, it says, \u2018United Express operated by\u2019 and some fine print (naming the operator). That\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going.\u201d As an independent company, Eagle should be stronger because it will be able to bid for work with other airlines besides American, Garton added. Ray Neidl, an analyst with Maxim Group LLC, said expensive jet fuel has hurt regional airlines and made Eagle a growing financial burden on AMR. He said shedding the regional operation was long overdue. Shares of AMR rose 11 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $3.62 in morning trading. They hit a 52-week low of $3.28 on Monday. ___ Koenig can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/airlinewriter Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The pictures of Charla Nash were first shown on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and in Hearst Connecticut Newspapers on Thursday morning. They were later released by Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, where she had face transplant surgery in May. Nash, 57, didn\u2019t appear on \u201cToday\u201d because relatives said she was too weak to do an interview. In a statement released by the hospital, Nash thanked all the doctors, nurses and other medical experts who helped her over the past two years.  \u201cI will now be able to do things I once took for granted,\u201d Nash said in the statement. \u201cI will be able to smell. I will be able to eat normally. I will no longer be disfigured. I will have lips and will speak clearly once again. I will be able to kiss and hug loved ones. I am tremendously grateful to the donor and her family.\u201d The show aired footage of Nash in a hospital bed, nodding to visitors, her face smooth and features appearing nearly normal.  \u201cToday\u201d also reported that Nash was able to eat eggs with cream cheese after the transplant \u2014 the first solid food she\u2019s had since the attack. Nash, who\u2019s now living in a Boston-area nursing home, was attacked in February 2009 by a neighbor\u2019s 200-pound pet chimpanzee, which went berserk after its owner asked Nash to help lure it back into her house in Stamford, Conn. The animal, named Travis, ripped off Nash\u2019s nose, lips, eyelids and hands before being shot to death by police. Nash was left with no eyes and only a small opening where her mouth once was. She could only eat pureed food, and she was barely understandable when she talked. In late May, she underwent a full face and double hand transplant in Boston. She received skin, underlying muscles, blood vessels, nerves, a hard palate and teeth from a dead person who hasn\u2019t been named. It was the third full face transplant in the U.S. But doctors later had to remove the hands because of complications that developed when Nash caught pneumonia. Nash said she\u2019s hoping to attempt another double hand transplant one day. Asked by \u201cToday\u201d what she would say to the donor\u2019s family, Nash\u2019s daughter, Brianna, said she\u2019d tell them how grateful she is.  \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done for us is just so amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has really given my mom the hope to move forward, a chance at a life again.\u201d Nash\u2019s family is suing the estate of the chimpanzee\u2019s owner, Sandra Herold, for $50 million and wants to sue the state for $150 million, claiming officials failed to prevent the attack. Herold died last year of an aneurysm. Nash\u2019s brother, Steve Nash, told The Associated Press that his sister has maintained a positive outlook since the mauling, and the family hopes she can get the double hand transplant in about six months. She also has only a top row of teeth and doctors are planning to install a lower row soon, he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s brought my sister to a better quality of life. It makes you feel good, and we\u2019re very thankful,\u201d Steve Nash said about the face transplant. \u201cShe\u2019s preparing the best she can to be a blind person.\u201d ___ Online: NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show: http://on.today.com/pdWJSe Hearst Newspapers: http://www.hearst.com/newspapers Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

When he first started going there, his students were all beginners, because nobody in China knew much about throat singing. But they were eager to learn, and, after years of sharing his techniques, Odsuren took pride in having helped promote an art form prized here in Mongolia as a singular national treasure. His pride, however, turned to dismay and then anger when he saw a copy of a video that China had quietly submitted to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization: It featured one of his former students pitching a bid by Beijing to have throat singing registered by the United Nations as part of the \u201cintangible cultural heritage of humanity,\u201d with China getting the credit. \u201cI was in shock. I taught them and then they say it is theirs,\u201d Odsuren said. Throat singing \u2014 a fiendishly difficult practice that musicologists know as overtone singing \u2014 has often attracted interest, sometimes covetous, from outside Mongolia. The Russian region of Tuva, which borders Mongolia, tried briefly in the 1990s to brand it as Tuvan and impose a licensing system on throat singers.  Frank Zappa, the late American musician, jammed with a throat-rock ensemble called \u00adHuun-Huur-Tu, and folk music aficionados around the world have long marveled at how a good throat singer can produce two or more distinct pitches simultaneously in an otherworldly mix of melody and tone. But China has proved the most zealous fan of all: Its pitch worked, and the country got UNESCO to list Mongolian throat singing under China\u2019s name. Sitting in a dingy Soviet-style apartment, the 63-year-old teacher showed photographs of himself in happier times with his pupils in China and fumed at the betrayal: \u201cI don\u2019t like people lying and claiming something that everyone knows is Mongolian.\u201d A listing by UNESCO doesn\u2019t bring any money or copyright privileges, but it does confer bragging rights \u2014 and it helps China reinforce cultural claims viewed as essential to holding together a vast territory populated on the fringes by ethnic minorities of often uncertain loyalties. That includes a population of ethnic Mongolians, most of them in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia, which was hit by a wave of unrest in May and further protests in June fed by resentment against the area\u2019s majority Han Chinese.  By claiming \u2014 and controlling \u2014 culture, the Communist Party has sought to keep such tensions in check, not only in normally placid Inner Mongolia, but also in far more protest-prone regions such as Tibet and Muslim Xinjiang. \u201cThroat singing is part of China\u2019s splendid general culture because Mongolians are one of China\u2019s ethnic groups,\u201d said Li Qiang, director of Inner Mongolia\u2019s Song and Dance Academy, the institution where Odsuren taught. Arguments over who actually developed throat singing and where, Li added, aren\u2019t important because what matters today is who can best protect the art: \u201cRight now, we are strong and capable enough to do that.\u201d In 2009 and 2010, more than a quarter of all items inscribed by Paris-based UNESCO on its cultural heritage roster were from China. Cecile Duvelle, head of \u00adUNESCO\u2019s intangible cultural heritage section, said in response to written questions that a listing does not mean an item \u201cbelongs to the state\u201d or that China\u2019s cultural heritage \u201chas more or less value,\u201d but she added that the organization \u201cis nevertheless discussing this unbalanced situation.\u201d Many of the items under China\u2019s name are clearly Chinese, such as Peking Opera, acupuncture, dragon boat festivals and Chinese calligraphy. But also listed as Chinese are the epic of Manas, a poem that Kyrgyzstan considers the cornerstone of its national culture, as well as Tibetan Opera, and a Korean farmers dance.  A culture grab? When the United Nations first adopted a Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2003, the idea was to promote diversity and help indigenous peoples protect their heritage. Exactly which \u201cpractices, expressions, knowledge and skills\u201d are put on UNESCO\u2019s list gets decided by a U.N. committee made up of officials from 24 member states. And no country has been more active than China in nominating entries \u2014 to the chagrin of Mongolians, Kyrgyz, Tibetans and others whose culture is in part now registered as being from China. Scholars with no dog in the fight also have been taken aback by a system they complain is driven by bureaucratic process and power politics as much as concerns for cultural authenticity. \u201cI was very surprised to find the Chinese khoomei (throat singing) nomination,\u201d said Mark van Tongeren, a Dutch musicologist who served as an expert on a UNESCO review panel. \u201cFor me, it seemed obvious this was a tricky one.\u201d Li, the Song and Dance Academy director, denied any attempt by China to annex Mongolia\u2019s heritage, insisting that Inner Mongolia had its own throat singers long before Odsuren started teaching in China. \u201cWe prepared well, and we showed enough evidence (to UNESCO). No wonder we got it.\u201d Odsuren acknowledged that the area that is now Chinese Inner Mongolia did have throat singers in the distant past but said the art died out there long ago, a claim supported by China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency, which reported in 2006 that throat singing \u201cwas lost more than 100 years ago\u201d in China. Odsuren thinks this should have made China ineligible for a UNESCO listing because the tradition was not \u201ctransmitted from generation to generation\u201d as required by the 2003 convention. Li, for his part, said that although it looks \u201con the surface\u201d that throat singing had vanished in China, and \u201cwe thought so at first,\u201d it had in fact survived among Chinese nomads.  Under Mao Zedong, who ruled China from 1949 until his death in 1976, the Communist Party took a dim view of \u201cminority\u201d cultures. It still frowns on cultural activities it doesn\u2019t control, but is now eager to develop \u2014 and lay claim to \u2014 songs, dances and other art forms that it hopes will help cement the loyalties of Mongolians and other minorities. Ancient tune Throat singing is generally accepted to have originated in the west of what is now Mongolia. It is thought to have originated among herders mimicking the sounds of animals, water and the wind. The practice developed alongside animist beliefs that all natural objects have souls or spirits whose power humans can harness through mimicry.  Throat singing was spread by the explosive conquests of Genghis Khan and his descendants, one of whom, Kublai Khan, took control of China in 1271. Mongolia, which later fell under China\u2019s sway, became an independent state in 1921, but, with a population of only 2.8\u00a0million today, it is deeply wary of its 1.3-billion-strong neighbor and longtime rival to the south. When news of UNESCO\u2019s decision to endorse China\u2019s claim reached Ulaanbaatar, the Mongolian capital, Odsuren was pilloried in the local media for selling out Mongolian culture. China\u2019s UNESCO video included not only his former pupil \u2014 who declined to comment \u2014 but also footage of Odsuren during one of his visits to Inner Mongolia. \u201cI suffered for a whole year. There was a lot of commotion here about how I sold throat singing to the Chinese,\u201d Odsuren said. The furor calmed after Mongolia submitted its own entry for throat singing and, in November, secured a spot on UNESCO\u2019s list. The register now has two throat singing entries, one for China, one for Mongolia. \u201cWe already have our place on the list,\u201d said Li, the academy director in China, who is an ethnic Mongolian. \u201cIt\u2019s not the time to argue over which one is authentic.\u201d Odsuren said he\u2019s over his anger and doesn\u2019t bear any grudge toward Chinese Mongolians who now claim for China an art that he taught them. It\u2019s not easy, he said, being an ethnic minority in China, particularly in Inner Mongolia, where Mongolians are far outnumbered by Han Chinese and under pressure to prove their allegiance. \u201cThey have to do this kind of thing to get ahead. They\u2019ve got to serve the strong.\u201d higginsandrew@washpost.com Researcher Zhang Jie in Beijing  contributed to this report.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-10 17:45:00", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomworldasia-pacifica-showdown-over-traditional-throat-singing-divides-china-and-mongolia20110624giqasazs7i_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 105, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Driven to sing in the karaoke cab", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/driven-to-sing-in-the-karaoke-cab/2011/08/02/gIQA0sSJ3I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tThe cabbie idles up to the curb outside Whitlow\u2019s in Clarendon, rolls down his window and punches a number into his microphone.

Three years ago, he started to get bored, so he bought a portable karaoke machine, 2,000 songs and a bunch of wiring. Now he sings.

Their job, ostensibly, is to protect a radio tower and mainframe communications equipment from anti-government guerrillas who have been waging war since the 1960s. But the wanted posters on the base\u2019s bulletin board feature rebel operatives from the 1990s, and the reports labeled \u201csecret\u201d detail guerrilla activity dating back more than two years. So instead of looking out for rebel movements, the soldiers use their binoculars to search for birds \u2014 very big birds, with wings spanning 11 feet.  It turns out that Squad G of Mechanized Group No. 1 of the Colombian army\u2019s 1st Brigade is perfectly positioned here on Pena Negra, or Black Cliff, to track the magnificent Andean condors that float on fast-moving thermals 15,000 feet in the sky.  \u201cHere, there is not much of a conflict,\u201d said Edison Quitian, 34, a soldier recently assigned to the base. \u201cSince we are here, watching out over everything, then we can monitor the condors, and if anything is wrong, let the right people know.\u201d In an 11-year career, Quitian has been assigned to muggy lowland regions swarming with rebels and brimming with violence. Now, he said, he rarely raises his Israeli-made Galil assault rifle. The only time he takes aim is when the condors knife through the sky and he snaps their picture.  \u201cIt is not every day that you see them,\u201d Quitian said. \u201cSo we take their pictures. You could not have imagined that you would come across these birds.\u201d  The soldiers\u2019 excitement about the condors is reassuring to Olga Lucia Nunez, a biologist who roams the high peaks and deep valleys of these mountains, in Boyaca state in central Colombia, recruiting farmers, shepherds and, most recently, soldiers, in a broad effort to monitor and protect the birds.  With funding from Corpoboyaca, the state environmental agency, Nunez\u2019s environmental group, Fundetropico, is working with U.S. zoos to spur the condor population. Success largely hinges on ensuring that rural villagers, who traditionally hunt wild game, do not target the 30 or so condors that patrol above this mountain range.  \u201cWe want people to know these are a special species,\u201d Nunez said. \u201cFarmers have heard stories that the condors snatch children, that they kill calves, even that they are witches. So you have to talk to them, you have to explain.\u201d Going from hamlet to farmhouse, speaking in rural one-room schoolhouses and rustic churches, Nunez has patiently explained the wonders of vultur gryphus, the national bird here and in three other Andean countries. To many of those she encounters, the condors are simply fearsome creatures, with their powerful beaks, chickenlike claws, black cape of feathers and beady red eyes. Nunez, though, makes clear that condors do not kill livestock, nor do they fly off with children. Rather, they are a vital part of one of the most unusual ecosystems in the world, the high paramo, with its carpet of squishy plant life that collects huge amounts of water, which nature sporadically releases to feed Colombia\u2019s rivers. \u201cThey keep the mountains clean,\u201d said Nunez, noting that an adult can quickly gulp down several pounds of decomposing flesh, using a tubelike neck to poke around inside a carcass. A novel approach  To reestablish the condor, Colombian and American biologists came up with a novel approach \u2014 raising condor chicks in U.S. zoos and then releasing them on Colombian peaks, where they are then monitored via tiny radio transmitters attached to their wings.  Michael Mace, curator of birds at the San Diego Zoo, said the chicks are brought up by their parents and placed in social groups where they interact with other condors. When they are about a year old, he said, they are sent to Colombia.   \u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise the absolute best condor possible for release,\u201d Mace said by phone from San Diego, one of 16 American zoos raising condors for release here. \u201cThey\u2019re not animals that are raised to where they act like people or want to be around people.\u201d Mace said a milestone was reached after biologists recorded that released birds had begun raising their own offspring. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for now is exponential growth in that population,\u201d he said, noting that biologists will soon be tracking the birds by satellite telemetry.  It is slow going, though.  Condors take four or five years to mature enough to raise offspring. Even then, they only lay an egg every two years. Success is measured in a hatchling or two, or in the rare sighting of a small group of condors. Seventy-one condors have been released in Colombia over 20 years, and this country\u2019s overall condor population is only now approaching 200. But Nunez said the total number of condors is more than twice what it was early in the past decade, and the birds are now flying in regions where they had not been seen in years, such as Boyaca. It is a dramatic turnaround, she said, from 2004, when the first birds were released in these mountains.  \u201cThey didn\u2019t know how to find food,\u201d she recalled with a laugh. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know how to fly. They didn\u2019t know how to deal with the weather, either. They\u2019re from San Diego!\u201d There have been setbacks. Three of the 11 condors released in Boyaca have died \u2014 one ate poison, another was electrocuted by a power line and a third was found shot by the side of a road. But the other condors raised in American zoos appear to be faring well, Nunez said, and another 20 or so have migrated here from other mountain ranges. Taking condors seriously To catch sight of the birds requires a rocky, bumpy ride on narrow mountain passes to Pena Negra and the army base.  The commanding lieutenant on a recent day, Rodrigo Correa, 22, said he did not even know what a condor was until Nunez showed up one day to give a lecture on the birds. \u201cYou normally see this kind of stuff on the Discovery Channel,\u201d Correa said. \u201cWe decided to take it seriously and take part in the program.\u201d Now, the soldiers not only photograph the birds \u2014 pictures Nunez needs to keep track of the released condors, which wear special markings \u2014 but they also keep logs. Nunez has encouraged the soldiers to dump the remains of the cows they occasionally slaughter to provide the condors with a little extra food.  \u201cIt was 30 kilos of decomposing meat, intestines and skin,\u201d Cpl. Manuel Vargas said, describing the meal the condors had on a recent day. \u201cSix condors came, they fed, they rested and then they flew off. They just threw themselves into the abyss.\u201d foreroj@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-07 18:25:10", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomworldamericascolombian-condors-take-flight20110803giqatpvm1i_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 111, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:10:19", "headline": "Intimate, long \u2018Hoffmann\u2019 has problems at Wolf Trap Opera", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/intimate-long-hoffmann-has-problems-at-wolf-trap-opera/2011/08/07/gIQAl4HD1I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tIf you want to learn why opera fans love opera so much, try sitting in a small space and hearing a trained opera singer in full cry: The visceral power is hard to resist. The greater Washington area offers a number of places where you can test this thesis. Chamber opera is thriving all across the country, but our region is a national leader in one niche: summer opera festivals devoted to presenting young professionals. Between the Castleton Festival and the Wolf Trap Opera, we get some of the cream of the crop.  But why do both Castleton and Wolf Trap seek repeatedly to stake out the large-scale standard operatic repertory? Castleton opened its season this year with Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boheme\u201d; on Friday night, the Wolf Trap Opera offered Offenbach\u2019s \u201cTales of Hoffmann\u201d (there are additional performances on Thursday and Saturday).  \u201cHoffmann\u201d sets the bar particularly high. Experienced tenors blanch at the thought of the long, tough role of an ardent and addled poet that has you onstage singing your heart out for a good portion of a long night. (Wolf Trap\u2019s production began at 8 and ended at 11:30, with two intermissions.)  On Friday, Nathaniel Peake hid his blanching and paced himself pretty well; his outing as Pirelli in \u201cSweeney Todd\u201d a couple of weeks ago sounded a lot more forced and effort-full. Still, his Hoffmann didn\u2019t sound easy. His voice has a lot of promise, a clarion firmness that comes out best when it\u2019s not forced, and he has some musical sensitivity. I would have loved to see him in a role that would let him blossom, though he may have learned valuable lessons from pacing himself through this marathon.  What really suffers in this kind of endurance test is the focus on details. The evening\u2019s standout was Catherine Martin as Nicklausse, Hoffmann\u2019s muse, who appears in the guise of a trusted (male) companion for most of the evening. Martin has a gorgeous, warm voice that you want to keep listening to (no small achievement in a role that often seems tiresome), and she\u2019s a big talent. Wolf Trap is a place where she should be learning to avoid the occasional loss of color and focus she showed on individual notes \u2014 but that kind of detail is overlooked when your main focus is getting through a long evening.  \u201cHoffmann\u201d is something of a troubled opera: Unfinished at Offenbach\u2019s death, it\u2019s been subject to any number of tweaks, rearrangements and additions in the 130 years since its premiere, and the very order of its three acts is a subject of debate. The poet Hoffmann, loosely based on German romantic author E.T.A. Hoffmann, is in love with opera singer Stella, and tells his drinking buddies three stories (adapted from Hoffmann\u2019s works) of three past lovers, each encapsulating one aspect of Stella\u2019s character: Olympia, a mechanical doll; Antonia, an opera singer; and Giulietta, a courtesan.  Offenbach wanted all three roles sung by the same woman; the roles are still a showpiece for star sopranos, but Wolf Trap sensibly gave the parts to three singers. Jamie-Rose Guarrine was an imprecise and womanly Olympia; Marcy Stonikas managed to sing a credible Antonia while heavily pregnant (giving real motivation for her father\u2019s hatred of Hoffmann); and Eve Gigliotti was a strong, impassioned Giulietta.  The roles of the villains, however, were all taken by the same singer, the impressive Craig Irvin, who sounded particularly good in \u201cScintille, diamant,\u201d an aria that was interpolated into the opera after Offenbach\u2019s death. Israel Gursky conducted convincingly in a pit so crowded that the harpist had to sit outside it (not uncommon in this tiny theater), and set designer Michael Olich made creative use of rotating wooden boxes to get the opera\u2019s fantastical party scenes and rowdy tavern on the tiny stage.  Dan Rigazzi, the director, also made a virtue of intimacy, in part by having the different characters in Hoffmann\u2019s tales \u201cplayed\u201d by fellow drinkers at the pub, so the whole thing seems partly a sequence of students\u2019 skits. And yet he, too, didn\u2019t attend enough to details \u2014 such as Edward Mout\u2019s relentless overacting in the roles of the three elderly servants. These small things used to make the difference between an ad\u00adequate production and a first-rate one. There was much to like about this \u201cHoffmann,\u201d but these singers, and the Wolf Trap Opera, are capable of doing even better.  midgettea@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-07 16:33:49", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomlifestylestyleintimate-long-hoffmann-has-problems-at-wolf-trap-opera20110807giqal4hd1i_storyhtmlwprssrss_national"}}, {"pk": 117, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 12:17:54", "headline": "US stocks rise on encouraging unemployment claims report a day after Dow\u2019s ninth-worst day", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/markets/us-stock-futures-drop-a-day-after-another-big-decline-better-than-expected-cisco-profit/2011/08/11/gIQA6jQO8I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. stocks are opening higher after a strong report on retail sales soothed economic jitters that have driven record-setting gains and losses this week.

Now, Pawlenty really needs to do that. With eight Republican contenders gathering in Ames, Iowa, Thursday night for another nationally-televised debate, the stakes are higher for Pawlenty than any other candidate. After beginning the year amid the highest of expectations, Pawlenty\u2019s failure to swing at Romney last time is now cemented in the public view \u2014 and his continuing struggle to improve in the polls and raise big money prove the point. Worse, perhaps, is that now Pawlenty\u2019s chief rival is fellow Minnesotan Michele Bachmann, whose dynamic performance at that first debate propelled her to within striking distance of Romney in national polls \u2014 and positioned her as a leading contender to win the crucial straw poll in Iowa on Saturday. Pawlenty must perform exceptionally well at the Ames Straw Poll if his campaign is to improve its position heading into the fall, when attention will be focused squarely on Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses at the start 2012. That makes Thursday\u2019s debate all the more important for him \u2014 and all the more complicated a moment at which a candidate not known for his flashy rhetoric must distinguish himself. Pawlenty\u2019s marathon itinerary across Iowa since June provides ample clues as to what he hopes to convey Thursday night to a national audience of party leaders, would-be donors and regular Republican voters whose impressions he must sway.  The former governor has the experience, he likes to say, that other Republicans in the field lack \u2014 a not so thinly-veiled rap at Bachmann, who is serving her third two-year term in Congress. He draws a contrast with Romney, too, promoting an eight-year record as governor that included lowering taxes, picking a fight with transit unions and reforming health care without imposing an individual mandate (one of Romney\u2019s biggest weaknesses among GOP voters is his support of health-care legislation in Massachusetts that became a foundation of President Obama\u2019s plan). In other words, Pawlenty likes to say, while the other Republicans say all the right things, he\u2019s actually done them. At dozens of town-hall-style sessions and speeches to small crowds in diners and other gathering spots in every corner of the state, Pawlenty has been energetic and engaged, and Republican voters who have gotten the chance to see him personally have come away impressed with his knowledge, his record and his positions on the issues. It\u2019s harder to make that point on national television. Pawlenty must do exactly that on Thursday if his campaign is to gain momentum.

With almost no political experience, the conservative radio host and CEO of Godfather\u2019s Pizza is the clear outsider of the 2012 Republican primaries. Over the past few months, huge numbers of supporters have flocked to his the candidate\u2019s ramshackle campaign events , earning Cain the credibility to appear onstage in Iowa tonight. Cain pitches himself as a businessman-candidate in the tea party mold, which means he sells his lack of political experience as a positive.  (One of his stump speech one-liners: \u201cI understand how Washington works! It doesn\u2019t!\u201d). With Congress\u2019s approval ratings hitting record lows, Cain\u2019s outsider status could help him in Iowa.   As a longshot candidate, Cain enters the debate with low expectations. He\u2019s already succeeded simply by getting invited and having the chance to promote his unusual slate of issues, including replacing federal and state income taxes with a 23 percent national sales tax.  \u201cTo get on stage in front of several million people watching at home is a great chance for folks to see Mr. Cain and what he stands for and what his background is and what his vision is,\u201d  Cain spokeswoman Ellen Carmichael told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. But Cain must also live down his now-infamous comments that he would not be \u201ccomfortable\u201d with a Muslim in his Cabinet. Cain stumbled when he was questioned about this comment at the June New Hampshire debate and replied that he had not answered the question of whether he would appoint a Muslim. His answer in the New Hampshire debate was: \u201cI would not be comfortable because you have peaceful Muslims and then you have militant Muslims, those that are trying to kill us. And so, when I said I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable, I was thinking about the ones that are trying to kill us, number one....\u201d Maybe people have forgotten about the issue and have moved on. Cain turned in a good debate performance in South Carolina in May, and perhaps we\u2019ll see that candidate again in Iowa Thursday night.

Pelosi (D-Calif.) chose Reps. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), giving the panel the highest-ranking African-American and Latino lawmakers in Congress with Clyburn and Becerra, respectively. Pelosi reiterated her call for Congress to consider \u201cthe grand bargain\u201d of major entitlement cuts matched with increased taxes. \u201cWe must achieve a \u2018grand bargain\u2019 that reduces the deficit by addressing our entire budget, while strengthening Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Our entire Caucus will work closely with these three appointees toward this goal, which is the goal of the American people,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cBecause the work of this committee will affect all Americans, I called last week for its deliberations to be transparent; the committee should conduct its proceedings in the open.\u201d Clyburn is the No. 3 Democratic leader and Becerra is the No. 5 member of her leadership team. As the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Van Hollen is an adjunct member of leadership and previously spent four years as the party\u2019s campaign strategist as the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The three House Democrats complete the 12-member panel, which must turn in its recommendations for $1.2 trillion in additional spending cuts by Thanksgiving or risk pulling an automatic trigger for deep cuts to federal agencies and defense programs. Of the 12, ten voted for the debt-ceiling deal that rescued the country from the brink of default, which suggests at least the possibility that the 12-member panel will be able to reach a bipartisan agreement on future spending cuts. The  two panel members to oppose the debt compromise are Becerra and  Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.).  The other eight members of the panel are Republican Sens. Jon Kyl (Ariz.) and Rob Portman (Ohio), Republican Reps. Jeb Hensarling (Tex.), Dave Camp (Mich.) and Fred Upton (Mich.), and Democratic Sens. Patty Murray (Wash.), Max Baucus (Mont.) and John F. Kerry (Mass.). Murray and Hensarling are co-chairs. On Wednesday, following the lead of Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced their picks for the new panel.  \u201cThe lawmakers I have appointed to serve on this joint committee are proven leaders who have earned the trust and confidence of their colleagues and constituents,\u201d Boehner said in a statement.  On Tuesday, Reid praised his picks for their \u201cexpertise in budget matters, a commitment to a balanced approach and a track record of forging bipartisan consensus.\u201d The question now is whether this group can draw on its combined 180-plus years of congressional experience to forge an agreement or whether it will end up gridlocked in a manner similar to other special fiscal panels established to solve the nation\u2019s economic woes. Budget experts rendered a split verdict about the group\u2019s chances, with no one doubting the panel\u2019s credentials. Even the \u201csupercommittee\u2019s\u201d most junior members, the freshman senators Toomey and Portman, have 18 years of combined experience in the House before joining the Senate in January. Portman has also done two stints in Republican White Houses, including as President George W. Bush\u2019s director of the Office of Management and Budget. \u201cThe truth is, you\u2019ve got a lot of IQ points,\u201d Steve Bell, senior policy analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said of the selections. Bell said that he was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by most of the panel picks and that there was a \u201c50-50 chance\u201d the emerging group could craft a sweeping bipartisan pact similar to the \u201cgrand bargain\u201d that President Obama sought to close the budget deficit.  Other budget experts were more pessimistic about the panel\u2019s chances of finding steep spending cuts. James Horney, a fiscal policy specialist at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, placed the odds of the committee\u2019s producing a big agreement at less than 25 percent. He said the appointees were the sort of dealmakers who could foster a broad pact only if party leaders loosened the reins, particularly if the Republicans are to accept increased tax revenue as part of the discussion. \u201cIf there\u2019s a desire to take a different approach, these are people who could try to work together and get things done,\u201d Horney said. The committee is the by-product of the bipartisan deal approved last week that allowed Obama to increase the nation\u2019s debt ceiling by $900 billion this year. The deal made next year\u2019s increase contingent upon the special committee finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings over the next decade.  There are six members from each party, and a minimum of seven votes are needed to approve a final report, which would be issued before Thanksgiving. The panel would send the plan to the House and Senate floors for fast-track votes by Dec. 23. Failure to approve a report would result in an automatic reduction of $1.2 trillion in federal agency spending, equally drawn from security programs and those that benefit the middle class. After Boehner and McConnell released their picks Wednesday, Republicans slammed Reid\u2019s selection of Murray as the panel\u2019s co-chairman. As chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Murray is the chief fundraiser and campaigner for Senate Democrats in the 2012 campaign cycle. Her counterpart, Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said her position would give outside interest groups the feeling that \u201cthe pathway of influence on the deficit reduction committee runs through the coffers of a campaign committee.\u201d Democrats rejected that argument and pointed to Murray\u2019s nearly 19 years of Senate service, including senior positions on the Appropriations and Budget committees. Liberal environmental groups criticized the appointment of Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, slamming his close ties to the oil industry, whose tax breaks have been marked for possible elimination in recent debt talks. Overall, the lawmakers selected have a mixed record of forging compromise.  None were part of the bipartisan \u201cGang of Six\u201d in the Senate that proposed nearly $4 trillion in federal savings through a mix of cuts to federal agencies, entitlement reforms and increased tax revenue. Three of the supercommittee appointees \u2014 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus; Hensarling, the co-chairman of the panel; and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Camp \u2014 have opposed a similar bipartisan plan that was prepared last year by a fiscal commission appointed by Obama.  In 2005, Baucus led the Democratic opposition to GOP efforts at reforming Social Security, an issue that Republicans want to revisit. In 2008, Hensarling played a lead role in opposing the Wall Street bailout, helping to bring down the first vote on that legislation. Baucus and Camp have already been at work, along with Treasury officials, on bipartisan tax-reform issues. Upton is a bona fide moderate who had to beat back a \u201cdown with Upton\u201d campaign from a tea-party-affiliated group to claim the committee chairmanship last winter. Portman, as a House member a decade ago, forged alliances with some Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee to approve pension-reform plans.   kanep@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 09:58:38", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsnancy-pelosi-names-her-picks-to-supercommittee-completing-12-member-debt-panel20110811giqalkdu8i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 134, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 13:26:12", "headline": "Obama to talk job creation at Michigan battery plant, raise campaign money in New York City", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/obama-to-talk-job-creation-at-michigan-battery-plant-raise-campaign-money-in-new-york-city/2011/08/11/gIQACwCy7I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tNEW YORK \u2014 Aligning himself with a public fed up with economic uncertainty and Washington gridlock, President Barack Obama declared Thursday: \u201cThere is nothing wrong with our country. There is something wrong with our politics.\u201d His toughly worded message \u2014 he said there was frustration in his voice, in case anyone missed the point \u2014 came amid a series of polls showing that people are disgusted with political dysfunction and are dispensing blame all around, including on Obama. Obama aired his frustration with the ways of Washington at an event in Michigan before pivoting to his re-election campaign and a pair of big-money fundraisers in New York City. He delivered a condensed version of that message at a fundraiser at the lower Manhattan home of movie producer Harvey Weinstein, where celebrities Gwyneth Paltrow and Jimmy Fallon, were among the approximately 50 guests who paid $35,800 each to attend. Obama said he told his Michigan audience that it deserves better than what it\u2019s been getting from Washington.  \u201cThey look at what\u2019s happening in Washington and they think these folks are really from outer space because they don\u2019t seem to understand how critical it is for us all to work together, Republicans, Democrats, independents, in order to move this country forward,\u201d Obama said. He added that the country is realizing the need to get involved.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get engaged and we\u2019re going to have to speak out,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to register the fact that we expect more and we expect better.\u201d Obama\u2019s visit Thursday to Holland, Mich., and New York, was his first official trip outside Washington after spending more than a month in the nation\u2019s capital dealing with the debt debate. Obama said Americans were right to be worried about the country\u2019s 9.1 percent unemployment rate and fluctuations in the stock market. The contentious and partisan debt debate in Washington, he said, has done little to help.  \u201cUnfortunately what we\u2019ve seen in Washington in the last few months has been the worst kind of partisanship, the worst kind of gridlock, and that gridlock has undermined public confidence and impeded our efforts to take the steps we need for our economy,\u201d Obama said after touring a Michigan factory that makes advanced batteries for alternative-fuel vehicles. A Washington Post poll released this week showed widespread and deep discontent with Washington. Nearly 80 percent said they were dissatisfied with the way the country\u2019s political system works, compared with 60 percent in November 2009. Seventy-one percent said the federal government is mostly focused on the wrong things, up from 55 percent in October 2010. Both Obama and congressional Republicans were targets of unhappiness, with only 19 percent of people polled saying that Obama had made progress in solving the country\u2019s major problems, and just 10 percent saying that about Republicans. At the same time, 28 percent said Obama had made things worse, while 35 percent said congressional Republicans had done that. Obama sought to channel the public\u2019s anger in order to avoid being sunk by it himself. He urged the public to tell Washington lawmakers they\u2019d had enough with the bickering and stalemates.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to tell them you\u2019ve had enough of the theatrics, you\u2019ve had enough of the politics, stop sending out press releases. Start passing some bills that we all know will help the economy right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they need to do. They\u2019ve got to hear from you.\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, promptly responded with a news release, calling the president\u2019s remarks \u201cpolitical grandstanding\u201d and urging him to deliver on promises to outline recommendations to rein in the nation\u2019s deficits. The president has said he will send those recommendations in the coming weeks to a congressional supercommittee tasked with finding $1.5 trillion in savings. He also said on Thursday that he\u2019d be offering new proposals \u201cweek by week\u201d to create jobs, though he provided no details. Despite Obama\u2019s calls for urgent action on the economy, Congress has left Washington for its August recess and Obama will soon follow for his annual summer vacation in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Obama urged lawmakers to get to work in September and pass a series of initiatives the White House says will spur job growth, including an extension of the payroll tax cut, three free-trade agreements and funding for road and bridge construction. Obama has touted spending on clean-energy technologies as a job creator, and on advanced batteries such as those made at the Johnson Controls plant in Holland, Mich., as a way to boost U.S. auto companies. Obama won Michigan in the 2008 presidential election and the economically battered state is crucial to his re-election hopes in 2012. After the Michigan stop, Obama attended a pair of fundraisers in lower Manhattan that raised more than $2 million. He attended a reception with about 15 people at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Battery Park that was thrown by Gary Hirshberg, chief executive of organic yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm, before heading to dinner at Weinstein\u2019s brick row house. Weinstein and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour were hosts. Other notables seated at the round dinner tables were New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, singers Alicia Keys and Chris Martin, who is Paltrow\u2019s husband, Gayle King and designer Vera Wang. Obama\u2019s motorcade passed by ground zero on the way to the dinner. The $35,800 admission price is the legal maximum donation per person.

The administration\u2019s signature \u201cFeed the Future\u201d program is facing potentially steep cuts by Congress. The White House has requested $1.4 billion for the project in 2012. But a House Appropriations subcommittee recently slashed several accounts that could leave the program with about one-third less in funding.  Clinton said that Africa had seen cyclical droughts for decades and that \u201cit would be easy to throw up our hands.\u201d But, she said, working with poor countries to provide things such as improved seeds and extension services could save lives. Feed the Future is part of an international effort to improve the productivity of small farmers in Africa and other impoverished regions. \u201cWhile some might say that this is a conversation for another time \u2014 that we should worry about preventing food crises only after this one has passed \u2014 I respectfully disagree,\u201d she said in a speech at the International Food Policy Research Institute, based in Washington.  \u201cRight now .\u2009.\u2009. we must rededicate ourselves to breaking the cycle of food shortages, suffering and dislocation that we see playing out once again in the Horn of Africa.\u201d She said that, because of international agriculture programs, the number of Ethiopians at risk of starvation had plummeted from 13 million in the 2002 drought to 5 million in the current disaster.   About 12 million people are in dire need of food in East Africa because of the drought and limited access to parts of Somalia controlled by the extremist group al-Shabab.  Clinton appealed to al-Shabab to drop its opposition to international aid groups bringing food to the country. The U.S. government considers al-Shabab a terrorist organization. Clinton also announced $17 million more in U.S. emergency funding to help victims of the drought, with $12 million of it going to Somalia. That brings the U.S. contribution to the humanitarian crisis to more than $580 million.     \u201cFamine conditions in Somalia are likely to get worse before they level off,\u201d Clinton said. That echoed an assessment Wednesday by the U.N. assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, Catherine Bragg, who said further deterioration of the situation is likely because of the severe malnutrition in the region, poor rains and skyrocketing local food prices. sheridanm@washpost.com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>", "entities": [], "active": true, "publication_date": "2011-08-11 10:27:48", "guid": "true", "slug": "httpwwwwashingtonpostcomworldnational-securityclinton-dont-cut-farm-aid-for-africa20110811giqafnjx8i_storyhtmlwprssrss_politics"}}, {"pk": 153, "model": "feed.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 4, "updated": "2011-08-12 10:40:12", "created": "2011-08-11 14:12:59", "headline": "How a D.C. area family with 11 children, ages 12 through 1, makes it work", "lead_image_url": null, "permalink": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/how-a-dc-area-family-with-11-children-ages-12-through-1-makes-it-work/2011/07/26/gIQAROAk6I_story.html?wprss=rss_national", "content": "\t\t\t\t\tLike other mothers, Jen Kilmer makes sure all her children are accounted for before pulling away in the car. Her routine begins with a cheer:  Mom: \u201cAre we ready?\u201d Kids: \u201cYes, we are!\u201d Mom: \u201cKilmer family .\u2009.\u2009.\u201d All: \u201cRah, rah, rah!\u201d Then the roll call begins: Christina (\u201cHere!\u201d), Joe (\u201cHere!\u201d), Michelle (\u201cHere!\u201d), Julie (\u201cHere!\u201d), Tommy (\u201cHere!\u201d), Steven (\u201cHere!\u201d), Matthew (\u201cHere!\u201d), John Paul (\u201cHere!\u201d), Larry (\u201cHere!\u201d), Rosemary (\u201cHere!\u201d), Peter (with help from older siblings, \u201cHere!\u201d).  Yep, Jen Kilmer has 11 children. They range in age from 12 to 1. No twins or triplets, but six sets of children born less than a year apart. With the average U.S. family household having less than one child, according to the 2010 Census, the Kilmer family is clearly an anomaly. And the family\u2019s day-to-day life is one many of us would find unmanageable.  Yet Jen, 45, a stay-at-home mom, and husband Larry, 53, a high school teacher, make it work. And despite years of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion, the Rockville family says they\u2019re having fun. \u201cWe\u2019re laughing a lot,\u201d says Jen. \u201cAnd within minutes, we can have a family soccer game. Not many families can say that.\u201d Not many families can say they need a 15-passenger van to go places together either. Or that they get mistaken for a day-care group when they go to a restaurant. Or that they go through two gallons of milk and two loaves of bread each day. Or that they spent six years with four children simultaneously in diapers. Despite the high potential for pandemonium, the Kilmer household is orderly and unchaotic. Beds are made, clothes are folded and the children help around the house.  There is no secret formula to their success, says Jen (and aside from an occasional hand from in-laws, no outside child-care help either). But clearly, keeping on top of a family this size requires superhuman doses of organization and patience. Not to mention a level of personal sacrifice beyond measure. \u201cPeople are always asking, \u2018How do you have time for yourself?\u2019\u2009\u201d says Jen. \u201cBut when you realize there\u2019s more to life than yourself .\u2009.\u2009. I think time to yourself is overrated.\u201d Jen and Larry met in 1994 when they were both teachers and soccer coaches at area Catholic high schools. Their soccer teams played each other; they married three years later.  Jen, who grew up on a small farm outside Boston with eight siblings, says she always wanted lots of kids. Larry, who was adopted and has one sibling, had no preconceived notions of family. The couple say they agreed to accept the children God sent them. Nine-and-a-half months after their wedding, their first child was born. Eleven-and-a-half months later, a second arrived. Today, the Kilmers\u2019 children are ages 12, 11, 10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3 and 1.  A day in the life During the school year, Jen\u2019s days begin at 5 a.m.  She lays out the children\u2019s uniforms, makes lunches, then attends 6:30 Mass at the Shrine at St. Jude.  After Mass, Larry and the oldest boys leave for school.  The remaining school-age children get dressed, eat breakfast, grab lunches and walk to school. The youngest stay home with Mom, who finishes up the morning routine: cleaning from breakfast, making beds and putting in a load of laundry. This fall, two of the three youngest will start preschool, adding a little wrinkle to the established morning routine.  Getting everyone off to school can be chaotic, says Jen, but she rarely feels overwhelmed by her daily to-do list.  \u201cSo many people are surprised when I say that,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe after a while you just have coping techniques.\u201d One coping technique is routine. Once Jen establishes a system that works, she\u2019s diligent about implementing it so nothing ever gets out of control, a necessity for a large family in a small house.  Family cleanup times come twice daily: right before 3 and after dinner. When mail comes through the door, it\u2019s dealt with immediately. (\u201cI never let it touch the table because it would stay there,\u201d she says.) The children\u2019s art projects are in constant rotation; artwork goes up on the fridge for a week, then gets filed away. When preparing for a family trip, she gives each child a large Ziploc bag and a detailed packing list.  She does four to five loads of laundry each day. Folded clothes get put in plastic drawers in the playroom labeled with each child\u2019s name. Twice a week, the kids bring their clothes upstairs.  The Kilmer command center is a roll-top desk that sits in the kitchen, keeping things such as mail, bills, permission slips and the laptop within arm\u2019s reach. \u201cI need to be near the command center, so it needs to be downstairs,\u201d says Jen. \u201cWhen the kids were little, when I came downstairs I wouldn\u2019t go back up until nighttime.\u201d Most of the children are home from school by 3. They have a snack and start homework while Jen begins dinner. As in many families, homework time can be stressful.  \u201cEveryone has questions, and I only have so much patience,\u201d says Jen. \u201cThe first- through fifth-graders need a lot of hand-holding.\u201d  When things get to be too much, she goes outside and sits on the back porch swing. \u201cSometimes,\u201d she says, \u201cyou just need a moment of peace.\u201d Family dinners take place around an eight-foot-long table with bench seating, recently given to them by a friend who no longer needed it. Previously, a second table had to be moved in and out of the kitchen every night.  Bedtime begins at 7:30, with the children taking shifts in their shared upstairs bathroom; some get ready for bed, others clean up downstairs.  By 9 p.m. all the children are in bed. It\u2019s the first quiet moment Jen\u2019s had since Mass more than 14 hours earlier. \u201cWhen the last one goes to bed, sometimes I sit down to relax,\u201d she says. Some nights, she\u2019ll take a 20-minute nap before tackling the rest of her work: cleaning the kitchen, more laundry and making sure uniforms are in order for the following day.  Jen credits her childhood as part of her preparation for being a mother to 11 children. \u201cEveryone had chores,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been trained to work hard. God was preparing me.\u201d Challenges Jen and Larry bought their four- (now five-) bedroom colonial when they had only one child. Moving into a bigger home now isn\u2019t financially possible, so they\u2019ve made adjustments.  They added a master bedroom suite with a bathroom and office space; the kids\u2019 rooms all have bunk beds. They moved the playroom into the larger family room area to accommodate all the toys. A wall was erected in the new family room space to prevent sound from the TV from traveling upstairs.  But a cramped house is just one of the challenges for the Kilmer family.  \u201cWe can\u2019t stay in a hotel because the ratio of children to adults is too high,\u201d says Jen. \u201cWe\u2019re considered a fire hazard.\u201d When one person gets sick, it could be a month before the virus leaves the house, she says, and one-on-one time between a parent and child, and between spouses, is limited. The biggest challenge, however, is money.  The day-to-day expenses for a family of 13 can be staggering. The Kilmers\u2019 grocery bills alone run about $300 per week. Add a mortgage, car payments, medical bills and home and auto repairs and the cost of Catholic school, and it\u2019s not surprising that some months they find it difficult to make ends meet.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have a college plan for tomorrow,\u201d says Jen, \u201cbecause we\u2019re trying to pay for the groceries today.\u201d To supplement his teaching income during the summer, Larry runs week-long sports camps and paints houses.  Jen is careful about spending, cuts coupons and find ways to work with what they have.  \u201cI recently learned [to make] soup,\u201d she says. \u201cThe kids eat veggies and I can stretch my meat.\u201d The couple say the generosity of others also helps them get by. \u201cWe\u2019ll get bags of clothing on the doorstep, and I don\u2019t even know who they\u2019re from,\u201d says Jen. People have given the family clothes, furniture, meals and grocery gift cards without being asked, says Larry.  \u201cEvery year it happens more and more,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd their generosity allows us to be generous to others.\u201d  The Kilmers frequently pass along clothing they no longer use to other families. Another wonderful lesson, they say, for the children.   Once, when most of the family was ill, word spread in the community. Within hours, family, friends, neighbors and colleagues appeared at their door to cook, clean and watch the children. For two weeks, meals were left by the front door.  Constant companions On a recent rainy Monday afternoon, Jen picks up the older children from soccer camp; the little ones, Larry, Rosemary (whom they call Rosie) and Peter, are with her. When she arrives at the camp, the oldest eight climb into the van, tousling the baby\u2019s hair and giving their mom a play-by-play of the day. From their car seats, 3-year-old Rosie and 1-year-old Peter are holding hands.  Later, as Jen prepares dinner, the six older boys, ages 4 through 11, have a lively Wii competition while Julie, 10, helps Rosie practice writing her name at the kitchen table and the older girls play with Peter. When Peter has had enough indoor play, Joe, 11, takes him for a walk around the neighborhood in the stroller.  \u201cYou always have someone to play with,\u201d says Michelle, 10, about the benefits of having many brothers and sisters.  \u201cYou\u2019re never bored,\u201d says Christina, 12. \u201cWhen you\u2019re close in age with someone, you have best friends.\u201d  Besides having built-in buddies, Jen says having so many siblings teaches the children leadership, teamwork, waiting their turn and helping one another.  \u201cI feel very strongly that the best gift you can give a child is a sibling,\u201d she says.  The rock of Faith Jen recalls the days when the family had seven children younger than 7.  \u201cI had to do everything for them from tying everyone\u2019s shoes to buckling them all into their car seats,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s when I just really felt exhausted.\u201d She admits to crying sometimes under the weight of it all. But those \u201cpity parties\u201d are short-lived. \u201cI can only feel sorry for myself for so long because there is work to be done,\u201d she says.  In the midst of the stress and commotion, the constant chorus of \u201cMom!\u201d and the backbreaking pace, Jen remains calm and cheerful. It\u2019s evident that part of what gives her peace as well as the confidence of knowing it will all work out is her Catholic faith. \u201cSomehow God provides,\u201d she often says, \u201cin ways you don\u2019t even know.\u201d That faith guides the children as well. When he grows up, Tommy, 9, says he wants to be \u201ca professional basketball player and a priest.\u201d  \u201cIf I am a professional basketball player,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll do that, retire and then become a priest.\u201d  When asked if more children are in their future, Jen mentions her age and says, \u201cProbably not, but we would love to. We would accept whatever comes.\u201d  Chat live: Wondering how Jen Kilmer does it? Ask her yourself when she chats with staff writer Terri Sapienza about what life is like with 11 kids.

But Anthony will not face additional charges as a result of Thursday\u2019s report. The Department of Children and Families closed out its investigations of Caylee\u2019s death, noting Anthony failed to protect Caylee by not reporting her disappearance in 2008 for more than a month, and that failure interfered with the law enforcement investigation and efforts to find the child. The agency also concluded that Caylee died as a result of abuse or neglect, but the report said the agency was unable to substantiate that the toddler had died from asphyxiation.  \u201cThe inactions by the mother were clearly failure to protect. As the child was found dead, obviously the failure to protect led to the death,\u201d DCF spokesman Joe Follick said. A jury last month acquitted Anthony in Caylee\u2019s death. She was released from jail and has dropped from public sight. A judge last week ordered her to return to Florida to serve probation on unrelated check fraud charges, but her lawyers appealed and another judge is expected to rule this week whether Anthony must follow that order. The child welfare agency\u2019s investigation was independent of the criminal investigation and the agency made no determination of who killed Caylee. The agency investigates every child death when there are allegations of abuse or neglect. The report is also on record in case families come back in the system. The child protective investigator who interviewed Anthony and her mother, Cindy, after Caylee\u2019s disappearance said Anthony blamed the sheriff\u2019s office for spending \u201cmore time trying to find me guilty without any evidence than trying to find Caylee,\u201d according to the report. When asked why she didn\u2019t report Caylee missing sooner, Anthony told the child investigator she made \u201csome bad decisions,\u201d the report states. Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

The men, whose names have not been released, were in serious but stable condition at Naval Medical Center. Details of their injuries were not released, and officials said they had not had the chance to speak to the men yet about what happened. The Marines were aboard an F/A-18 Hornet flying with another jet when it went down late Wednesday, kicking off a nighttime air-and-sea search by the Navy and U.S. Coast Guard that included dropping a flare to illuminate the area. They were found together around 2:30 a.m. Thursday, drifting along in their flight suits outfitted with inflatable life vests. A rescue swimmer dropped from a helicopter and plucked them from the ocean.  \u201cThey were just basically floating in the water,\u201d said Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Henry G. Dunphy. Details were not immediately available about what other survival gear the Marines might have had, and what conditions they faced in the water. The jet was not recovered and it was unclear if it would be. Officials were investigating the cause of the crash, said 1st Lt. Maureen Dooley, a spokeswoman at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. Marines in Southern California have had several crashes during training exercises this year. Last month, a decorated Marine from western New York was killed during a training exercise when his UH-1Y helicopter went down in a remote section of Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego. Another Hornet sustained at least $1 million damage when its engine caught fire on March 30 aboard the USS John C. Stennis during a training exercise about 100 miles off the San Diego coast. Eight sailors, a Marine and two civilians were injured. The Navy has said debris in the engine is the suspected cause of that fire. The Hornet, a twin-engine jet that can dogfight and attack ground targets, is a mainstay of the Navy\u2019s carrier force and has served in recent Middle East combat, but various models have been involved in mishaps in recent years. In April, two pilots were killed when their F/A-18F Super Hornet crashed during a training flight in a field near the Lemoore naval air station in Central California. The cause of the crash remains under investigation. The same month, an F/A-18C Hornet caught fire in the air over an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The pilot was unharmed. On Dec. 8, 2008, a Hornet with engine problems crashed in the University City area of San Diego, killing four people on the ground and incinerating two homes. The military disciplined 13 members of the Marines and Navy after the crash, which was blamed on mechanical problems and a string of bad decisions that led the pilot to bypass a potentially safe landing at an air station. _____ Jablon reported from Los Angeles.

Adriana Ferreyr filed the suit in Manhattan court on Wednesday. The 28-year-old Brazilian soap opera star alleges that the 80-year-old Soros gave the $1.9 million apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to a new girlfriend. Soros\u2019 lawyer William Zabel tells the New York Post (http://nyp.st/o7Drdd ) the lawsuit is frivolous, without merit and an attempt to extract money from his client. Ferreyr\u2019s lawyer Robert Hantman says it will be up to the court to decide. Ferreyr is attending Columbia University. The couple met in 2006. Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.
